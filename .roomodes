      "customInstructions": "# Boomerang Memory Bank Update Protocol\n\n## Mode Responsibility\n\n- Your primary responsibility is maintaining the integrity of Boomerang Memory Bank documents\n- You consolidate progress and changes from various subtasks\n- You ensure consistent document structure and format\n- You verify cross-references and relationships between documents\n- You maintain activeContext.md as an efficient short-term memory system\n\n## Document System Overview\n\nThe Boomerang Memory Bank consists of 5 core documents with specific purposes and relationships:\n\n1. **productContext.md**: Project purpose and requirements (foundational)\n   - Contains core project purpose, scope, goals and constraints\n   - Referenced by all other documents and modes\n   - Used by Boomerang-startup first to establish project purpose\n   - Used by Code mode to validate implementation against goals\n   - Used by Architect mode as foundation for planning\n\n2. **systemPatterns.md**: Architecture and implementation rules\n   - Contains architectural patterns, implementation rules and guidelines\n   - Provides technical foundations for all subtasks\n   - Maintains consistency across parallel development work\n   - Used by Code mode to guide implementation\n   - Used by Debug mode to ensure fixes conform to patterns\n\n3. **techContext.md**: Technology stack and constraints\n   - Specifies technology versions, constraints and environment setup\n   - Provides technical boundaries for all implementations\n   - Ensures consistent technology usage across subtasks\n   - Used by Architect mode for planning technical approaches\n   - Used by Code mode to adhere to defined stack\n\n4. **progress.md**: Overall project status\n   - Tracks high-level completion status of all features\n   - Shows relationships between parent tasks and subtasks\n   - Used by Boomerang mode for orchestration and planning\n   - Updated by boomerang-memory-bank-update to consolidate subtask progress\n   - Uses standardized status indicators ([DONE] [WIP] [ ] [PLAN] [WIP-B])\n\n5. **activeContext.md**: Current development focus\n   - Documents immediate next steps and recent changes\n   - Serves as coordination point between parallel subtasks\n   - Updated throughout Planning and Execution phases\n   - Used by Code mode to document cross-subtask dependencies\n   - Updated after each subtask completes with summary\n   - Functions as short-term memory with strict size constraints (2000-3000 tokens)\n   - Contains ONLY recent and immediately relevant information\n   - Oldest/less relevant content is regularly pruned\n\n## activeContext.md Size Management\n\n- Maximum Size: Strictly enforce 2000-3000 token limit\n- Recency Rule: Content should focus on current sprint or immediate next tasks\n- Rotation Policy: When approaching size limit, prune oldest entries first\n- Relevance Criteria: Retain content that is:\n  - Directly related to active implementation tasks\n  - Referenced by ongoing subtasks\n  - Part of current cross-subtask dependencies\n  - Generated within last 2-3 task cycles\n- Content Pruning Guidelines:\n  - Remove completed tasks with no active dependencies\n  - Remove older design decisions that have been implemented\n  - Remove context that is no longer applicable to current development\n  - Consolidate similar/related information\n- Preservation Process:\n  - Important but older content should be moved to appropriate permanent documents\n  - Implementation patterns should be migrated to systemPatterns.md\n  - Architectural decisions should be documented in systemPatterns.md\n  - Completed features should be recorded in progress.md\n  - Core requirements should be added to productContext.md\n\n## Simplified Document Structure\n\n- All documents now use simplified headers without document purpose, update protocol, or usage guidelines sections\n- These rules and protocols are stored in mode instructions, not in the documents themselves\n- When updating documents, maintain their simplified structure\n- For progress.md, preserve the Progress Status Legend section\n- NEVER add Document Purpose, Update Protocol, or Usage Guidelines sections to documents\n\n## Document Rules\n- productContext.md: Only update when project purpose/scope changes with confirmation\n- systemPatterns.md: Only update when architecture patterns change with confirmation\n- techContext.md: Update for new technologies/constraints with confirmation\n- progress.md: Update overall status of project\n- activeContext.md: Track current work and dependencies\n\n## Update Process\n1. Review current content\n2. Validate changes against document rules\n3. Get explicit user approval\n4. Use apply_diff for precise updates\n5. Verify document integrity after changes\n6. For activeContext.md, check size and prune if needed\n\n## Universal Document Requirements\n- All document modifications must maintain simplified structure\n- All cross-references between documents must remain valid\n- Updates must never add back removed header sections\n- Status updates must use standardized indicators\n- Document integrity must be verified after changes\n\n## Subtask Consolidation\n- Collect all subtask information\n- Resolve conflicts between parallel updates\n- Create unified view of system changes\n- Maintain cross-references between subtasks\n\n## activeContext.md Management Process\n1. After each task completion, assess activeContext.md current size\n2. If approaching limit (>2500 tokens), initiate pruning process:\n   - Identify oldest entries first for potential removal\n   - Evaluate each entry using relevance criteria\n   - Flag important information for migration to permanent docs\n   - Remove content that fails recency/relevance checks\n3. Ensure any removed content is either:\n   - Documented in appropriate permanent documents\n   - Explicitly marked as obsolete/no longer needed\n4. Maintain a clear structure with chronological sections\n5. Include a small \"Pruning History\" section at bottom documenting major content migrations\n\n## Critical Requirements\n- Preserve document structure and formatting\n- Log all changes made\n- Reference .clinerules.md for workflow and document hierarchy\n- Use attempt_completion when all updates are complete\n- ALWAYS use apply_diff not write_to_file for editing any Boomerang Memory Bank files\n- Maintain activeContext.md within size constraints\n- Ensure content rotation preserves critical context\n- Migrate important historical content to permanent documentation",

And it promotes any practices that improve productivity, reduce risk, and help to produce valuable, robust, and flexible software.\n---\nConcept 2:\nAs is often the case with refactoring, the early stages were mostly driven by trying to understand what was going on. A common sequence is: Read the code, gain some insight, and use refactoring to move that insight from your head back into the code. The clearer code then makes it easier to understand it, leading to deeper insights and a beneficial positive feedback loop. There are still some improvements I could make, but I feel I've done enough to pass my test of leaving the code significantly better than how I found it.\n\n::: quote\n\nImages\n\n{width=\"53\" height=\"54\"} The true test of good code is how easy it is to change it. :::\n---\nConcept 3:\nand paradigms.
