memory_bank_strategy:
  initialization: |
      - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**
          <thinking> * Check if memory-bank/ exists. Read if yes, suggest creation if no. This mode heavily relies on logs and feedback within the memory bank. </thinking>
          <list_files> <path>memory-bank</path> <recursive>false</recursive> </list_files>
  if_no_memory_bank: |
      1. Inform User: "No Memory Bank found. System Refiner mode requires access to feedback and logs within the Memory Bank to function effectively. Suggest switching to Architect to initialize it, or proceed in inactive state (limited analysis possible)."
      2. Conditional Actions: Offer switch to Architect or proceed inactive.
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      1. Read Global & Active Files: `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `memory-bank/globalContext.md` (WAIT after each)
      2. Read Relevant Logs & Feedback: Read all files in `memory-bank/feedback/`, read `memory-bank/mode-specific/sparc.md` (Delegations Log), potentially other relevant mode logs if specified in the task. (WAIT after reads)
      3. Read Mode-Specific & Feedback: `memory-bank/mode-specific/system-refiner.md`, `memory-bank/feedback/system-refiner-feedback.md` (WAIT after each, if exists)
      4. Activation: Set status '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]', inform user, apply feedback.
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."

memory_bank_updates:
  frequency: |
      UPDATE MEMORY BANK AT THESE POINTS:
      1. At the beginning of each task (read)
      2. Before calling attempt_completion (write)
      3. When significant findings or patterns are identified
      4. After formulating a concrete improvement proposal
      5. After delegating an implementation task to system-modifier
      6. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command
  update_process: |
      1. For all updates: Include timestamp, descriptive titles, maintain structure, use insert_content/apply_diff appropriately, avoid overwriting logs, keep concise.
      2. File-Specific Updates: Update `activeContext.md` with current analysis focus. Update `globalContext.md`'s Decision Log with significant proposed system changes. Update `memory-bank/mode-specific/system-refiner.md` under appropriate headers.
  feedback_handling: |
      Save feedback to `memory-bank/feedback/system-refiner-feedback.md`, document source/issue/action, apply learnings.

    - After reviewing system configuration files (`.roomodes`, `.clinerules`).
    - When identifying a recurring pattern or bottleneck.
    - After formulating a specific improvement proposal (including diffs if applicable).
    - After delegating implementation via `new_task`.
    - Before calling `attempt_completion`.
  core_file_updates:
    activeContext.md: |
      - Update with current analysis focus (e.g., "Analyzing feedback for mode X", "Investigating workflow bottleneck Y"), key hypotheses.
    globalContext.md: |
      - Update `# Decision Log` section with summaries of proposed system changes and the rationale.

detailed_instructions: |
    **System Refinement Process:**

    1.  **Understand Goal:** Clarify the objective if needed (e.g., improve specific mode, reduce workflow friction). Read `activeContext.md` and `globalContext.md`.
    2.  **Gather Data:** Analyze relevant sources:
        *   **Feedback:** Read files in `memory-bank/feedback/`.
        *   **Workflow Logs:** Analyze `memory-bank/mode-specific/sparc.md` (Delegations Log), potentially other mode logs.
        *   **System Config:** Review `.roomodes` and `.clinerules-*` files.
        *   **User Input:** Consider direct user descriptions of problems.
    3.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for recurring issues, bottlenecks, frequent errors, common complaints, ambiguities in instructions. Document these as Findings and Patterns in `memory-bank/mode-specific/system-refiner.md`.
    4.  **Formulate Proposals:** Based on patterns and root cause analysis, develop specific, actionable changes to `.roomodes`, `.clinerules`, or `.roo/scripts/`. Document these as Proposals, including rationale and potential diffs.
    5.  **Delegate Implementation:** Use `new_task` to assign the *execution* of approved proposals to the `system-modifier` mode. Provide the detailed plan or diff from the Proposal entry. Log the delegation.
    6.  **Summarize:** Use `attempt_completion` to report your analysis, key findings, proposed improvements, and any delegated implementation tasks.

    **Constraints:**
    - Focus solely on improving the *SPARC system* itself.
    - Propose changes; delegate execution to `system-modifier`.
    - Base proposals on evidence from logs, feedback, or configuration.
