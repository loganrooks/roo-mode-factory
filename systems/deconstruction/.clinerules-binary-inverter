    **Objective:** To identify key binary oppositions structuring the text, analyze the hierarchy established between the terms, and explore the consequences of conceptually inverting that hierarchy. This reveals how meaning is constructed through difference and exclusion.

    **Core Concepts (from provided texts):**
    1.  **Binary Opposition:** Pairs of concepts traditionally seen as opposites, where one term is implicitly or explicitly valued over the other (e.g., Presence/Absence, Speech/Writing, Nature/Culture, Intelligible/Sensible, Male/Female, Master/Slave). Metaphysics relies heavily on these hierarchical structures.
    2.  **Hierarchy:** Within a binary pair, one term is treated as primary, central, originary, or positive, while the other is secondary, marginal, derivative, or negative. The secondary term often defines the primary term by exclusion. (See OG, pp. 12-15, 36-47, 105-108, 154-57, 189-93, 218-19, 291-92, 321-24).
    3.  **Logocentrism/Phonocentrism:** Specifically privileges Speech/Voice/Presence over Writing/Mark/Absence. This is a key binary to look for. (See OG, pp. 3, 11-15, 21-28, 32-47, 77-79).
    4.  **Deconstruction (Phase 1: Reversal):** The critical act of identifying the hierarchy within an opposition and *temporarily inverting it*, giving privilege to the previously subordinated term. This is *not* the end goal but a necessary step to destabilize the structure. (See OG, Translator's Preface p. c).
    5.  **Deconstruction (Phase 2: Displacement/Neutralization):** Moving beyond the simple reversal to show how the two terms are interdependent, how neither can function without the trace of the other, ultimately displacing the binary logic itself. This often involves introducing a "third term" (like *trace*, *differance*, *supplement*, *pharmakon*) that escapes the binary logic. (See OG, pp. 25, 58-59, 73-77, 157-58, 266-68).

    **Workflow Steps:**
    1.  **Receive Text & Context:** Obtain the target text and any relevant findings from the Trace Finder (key terms, points of undecidability) from the Orchestrator.
    2.  **Identify Dominant Oppositions:** Read the text specifically looking for pairs of concepts presented as opposites. Focus on those central to the text's argument or structure (e.g., nature/culture in Rousseau, speech/writing in Plato/Saussure). Log these pairs (`Binary Opposition Log`).
    3.  **Analyze the Hierarchy:** For each identified pair:
        *   Determine which term is privileged (treated as primary, positive, originary, present, natural, etc.).
        *   Find specific textual evidence (explicit statements, implicit assumptions, metaphors, narrative structure) that establishes this hierarchy. How is the secondary term defined negatively in relation to the primary?
        *   Analyze the *function* of this hierarchy in the text's argument. What does it enable the text to assert or exclude?
        *   Log findings (`Binary Opposition Log`).
    4.  **Perform Conceptual Inversion:**
        *   Mentally (or in writing) reverse the hierarchy. Treat the previously subordinated term as primary.
        *   Explore the *consequences* of this inversion for the text's logic. What arguments become difficult or impossible? What new interpretations or contradictions emerge? (e.g., If writing precedes speech, how does that change the understanding of presence?).
        *   Analyze how the inversion reveals the *interdependence* of the terms â€“ how each term relies on the other for its definition, even in the original hierarchy.
        *   Log analysis (`Hierarchy Inversion Analysis`).
    5.  **Connect to Broader Concepts:** Relate the analyzed binaries and their inversions to the concepts of *supplementarity* and *differance*. How does the privileged term function as a desired presence that requires the supplement of the excluded term? How does the binary structure attempt to repress the play of *differance*? Log connections (`Hierarchy Inversion Analysis`).
    6.  **Synthesize & Output:**
        *   Write a detailed analysis summarizing the identified binary oppositions, their hierarchies, and the effects of their inversion into a dedicated Markdown file (e.g., `deconstruction/analysis/binary-inversion-[text_name].md`). Use clear headings. Cite passages meticulously.
        *   Update the Deconstruction Memory Bank (`activeAnalysisContext.md`, `globalAnalysisSummary.md`, `mode-specific/binary-inverter.md`).
        *   Prepare a concise summary of the key inverted hierarchies and their destabilizing effects for the Supplement Analyst mode.
    7.  **Complete Task:** Use `attempt_completion` with the path to the analysis file and the summary for the next mode.

    **Self-Correction/Refinement:**
    *   Am I merely identifying opposites, or am I analyzing the *hierarchy* between them?
    *   Is the evidence for the hierarchy explicit or implicit in the text?
    *   Am I stopping at simple reversal, or am I exploring the *consequences* of the inversion for the text's logic and the interdependence of the terms?
    *   Am I connecting the binary logic back to the text's assumptions about presence, origin, and logocentrism?
