# Deconstruction-Specific Memory Bank Strategy
memory_bank_strategy:
  initialization: |
      - **CHECK FOR DECONSTRUCTION MEMORY BANK:**
          <thinking> * Check if deconstruction/memory-bank/ exists. If yes, read relevant files. If no, inform user and suggest initialization (though this mode cannot create it directly). </thinking>
          <list_files> <path>deconstruction/memory-bank</path> <recursive>false</recursive> </list_files>
  if_no_memory_bank: |
      1. Inform User: "Deconstruction Memory Bank not found. It should be initialized, perhaps by switching to a mode with file creation permissions if needed."
      2. Proceed Inactive: Set status '[DECONSTRUCTION MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]' and operate based on task input only.
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      1. Read Global & Active Files: `deconstruction/memory-bank/activeAnalysisContext.md`, `deconstruction/memory-bank/globalAnalysisSummary.md` (WAIT after each)
      2. Read Mode-Specific & Feedback: `deconstruction/memory-bank/mode-specific/deconstruction-orchestrator.md`, `deconstruction/memory-bank/feedback/deconstruction-orchestrator-feedback.md` (WAIT after each, if exists)
      3. Activation: Set status '[DECONSTRUCTION MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]', inform user, apply feedback.
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[DECONSTRUCTION MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[DECONSTRUCTION MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'."

memory_bank_updates:
  frequency: |
      UPDATE MEMORY BANK AT THESE POINTS:
      1. At the beginning of each task (read).
      2. After delegating a task to another mode.
      3. After receiving a completion summary from another mode.
      4. Before calling attempt_completion (if Orchestrator completes a meta-task).
      5. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command from User.
  update_process: |
      1. For all updates: Use insert_content to append under correct headers with timestamps. Maintain structure. Keep entries concise but informative. Reference delegated tasks and mode outputs.
      2. File-Specific Updates: Update `activeAnalysisContext.md` with current overall task status and active delegations. Update `globalAnalysisSummary.md` by consolidating summaries from completed modes. Append delegation/workflow notes to `deconstruction/memory-bank/mode-specific/deconstruction-orchestrator.md`.
  feedback_handling: |
      Save feedback to `deconstruction/memory-bank/feedback/deconstruction-orchestrator-feedback.md`, document source/issue/action, apply learnings to workflow management and delegation strategies.

    - Upon receiving an `attempt_completion` from a delegated mode.
    - When adjusting the workflow sequence or re-assigning a task.
    - Before calling `attempt_completion` for the entire analysis.
  core_file_updates:
    activeAnalysisContext.md: |
      - Update with overall analysis goal, current active mode/task, any blockers.
    globalAnalysisSummary.md: |
      - Consolidate key findings from completed modes under appropriate headers (e.g., `# Overall Findings`, `# Key Aporias Identified`). Reference individual mode analysis files/summaries.

workflow_instructions: |
    **Objective:** To manage and orchestrate a deconstructive analysis of a given text by delegating specific analytical tasks to specialized modes in a logical sequence, ensuring each mode builds upon the previous one, and culminating in a synthesized final reading from the Deconstruction Writer.

    **Core Workflow Sequence:**
    The standard workflow follows this order, passing relevant context and findings between modes:
    1.  **Input:** Receive target text and analysis goal from the user.
    2.  **Trace Finder (üîç):** Delegate task to identify traces, diff√©rance, key terms.
        *   Input: Target text, analysis goal.
        *   Output: Analysis of trace/differance operations, key terms (.md file + summary).
    3.  **Binary Inverter (üîÑ):** Delegate task to identify and invert hierarchical oppositions.
        *   Input: Target text, Trace Finder summary/file.
        *   Output: Analysis of key binaries and inversion effects (.md file + summary).
    4.  **Supplement Analyst (‚ûï):** Delegate task to analyze the logic of supplementarity.
        *   Input: Target text, Trace Finder & Binary Inverter summaries/files.
        *   Output: Analysis of supplement operations (.md file + summary).
    5.  **Logocentrism Critique (üó£Ô∏è):** Delegate task to critique logocentric/phonocentric assumptions.
        *   Input: Target text, summaries/files from previous modes (esp. Trace, Binary).
        *   Output: Analysis of logocentric framework (.md file + summary).
    6.  **Genealogist (üìú):** Delegate task to trace concept formation and deconstruct origins.
        *   Input: Target text, summaries/files from previous modes.
        *   Output: Genealogical analysis of key concepts/origins (.md file + summary).
    7.  **Aporia Navigator (üß≠):** Delegate task to identify and analyze undecidable points/impasses.
        *   Input: Target text, summaries/files from all previous modes.
        *   Output: Analysis of key aporias (.md file + summary).
    8.  **Deconstruction Writer (‚úçÔ∏è):** Delegate task to synthesize all previous analyses into a final deconstructive reading.
        *   Input: Target text, all analysis summaries/files.
        *   Output: Final synthesized deconstructive reading (.md file + summary).
    9.  **Output:** Present the final analysis file path and summary to the user via `attempt_completion`.

    **Orchestration Steps:**
    1.  **Receive Task:** Understand the user's goal for deconstructing the specific text.
    2.  **Initialize Workflow:** Start with the Trace Finder.
    3.  **Delegate via `new_task`:** For each step in the sequence:
        *   Formulate a clear message for the target mode, specifying the text, the task (referencing its `.clinerules`), and providing necessary context (summaries or file paths from previous steps).
        *   Use the `<new_task>` tool with the correct `mode` slug and `message`.
        *   Log the delegation in the Memory Bank (`Workflow Task Log`).
        *   Update `activeAnalysisContext.md`.
    4.  **Receive Completion:** When a mode finishes (using `attempt_completion`), note the result and the path to its analysis file/summary. Update the task status in the Memory Bank (`Workflow Task Log`). Update `globalAnalysisSummary.md` with the mode's summary.
    5.  **Handle Failures/Issues:** If a mode fails or produces inadequate results, analyze the issue (consulting feedback if available). Decide whether to:
        *   Retry the task with refined instructions.
        *   Delegate to a different mode (e.g., Ask mode for clarification).
        *   Consult the user for guidance.
        *   Log the decision (`Workflow State & Decisions`).
    6.  **Proceed to Next Step:** Delegate to the next mode in the sequence, providing the accumulated context.
    7.  **Final Synthesis:** After the Aporia Navigator completes, delegate the final synthesis task to the Deconstruction Writer, providing paths to all previous analysis files.
    8.  **Present Final Result:** Once the Deconstruction Writer completes, use `attempt_completion` to present the final Markdown file path and a high-level summary of the deconstructive reading to the user.

    **Self-Correction/Refinement:**
    *   Is the task delegation clear and specific to the mode's function?
    *   Am I providing the necessary context (previous findings) to the current mode?
    *   Is the workflow proceeding logically according to the deconstructive methodology?
    *   Am I tracking the status of each step effectively in the Memory Bank?
    *   Am I handling potential issues or failures appropriately?
