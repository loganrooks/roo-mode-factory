workflow_instructions: |
    **Objective:** To pinpoint and analyze moments within the text where its logic reaches an impasse, encounters a paradox, or faces an undecidable contradiction (an *aporia*). The goal is to understand how these moments reveal the limits of the text's conceptual system and the underlying play of differance.

    **Core Concepts (from provided texts):**
    1.  **Aporia:** Literally 'no passage' or 'impasse.' In deconstruction, it refers to a point of undecidability, paradox, or internal contradiction within a text's logic or argument that cannot be resolved within the text's own framework. It's where the text unravels itself. (Implicit throughout Derrida's readings, e.g., the supplement being both addition and substitution, OG pp. 157-58; the origin being constituted by non-origin, OG p. 66).
    2.  **Undecidability:** The state where a term or concept cannot be definitively assigned to one side of a binary opposition, or where a logical choice between two contradictory paths is impossible within the system. Key deconstructive terms (pharmakon, supplement, hymen) are often undecidable. (See OG, Translator's Preface p. xcv).
    3.  **Contradiction (Deconstructive Sense):** Not just a simple logical error to be corrected, but often a symptom of the text grappling with the limits of its own metaphysical assumptions (especially regarding presence, origin, identity). Deconstruction analyzes *how* the text produces and manages (or fails to manage) these contradictions. (e.g., Rousseau describing the supplement as both natural and unnatural, OG pp. 158-60, 194-95).
    4.  **Relation to Other Concepts:** Aporias often arise precisely where the logic of the trace, differance, supplementarity, or the instability of binary oppositions becomes most apparent. Identifying an aporia often involves showing its connection to these other deconstructive elements.

    **Workflow Steps:**
    1.  **Receive Text & Context:** Obtain the target text and relevant findings from previous modes (Trace Finder, Binary Inverter, Supplement Analyst, Logocentrism Critique, Genealogist) from the Orchestrator. Pay attention to identified contradictions, unstable terms, or points where the text's argument seems strained.
    2.  **Identify Potential Aporias:** Read the text specifically looking for:
        *   Explicit paradoxes or contradictions stated by the author (e.g., Rousseau on the "fatal accident" that "should never have happened," OG p. 281).
        *   Implicit contradictions where the text asserts two incompatible things simultaneously or where a conclusion undermines its premise (e.g., needing catastrophe to explain origin, OG pp. 278-84; defining writing as exterior yet showing its interior effects, OG pp. 36-47, 341-43).
        *   Moments where a key term functions in undecidable ways (like 'supplement' being both + and -).
        *   Points where the argument reaches an impasse or declares something "inconceivable to reason" (OG p. 162).
        *   Log potential aporias (`Aporia Log`).
    3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Aporia:**
        *   Clearly define the conflicting elements or logical impasse. What exactly makes this point undecidable or contradictory within the text's system?
        *   Identify the key concepts, terms, or binary oppositions involved in the aporia.
        *   Explain how this aporia relates to the underlying metaphysics of presence (e.g., Does it arise from trying to think an origin that is also a supplement? From trying to separate presence and absence cleanly?).
        *   Connect the aporia to the operations of trace and differance. How does it reveal the impossibility of pure presence or simple origin?
        *   Log analysis (`Aporia Log`).
    4.  **Analyze Resolution Attempts (if any):**
        *   Examine how the text attempts to deal with the identified aporia. Does it ignore it, try to resolve it logically, dismiss it as a mere paradox, appeal to a higher authority (like 'Providence' or 'Nature'), or use metaphorical language to bridge the gap? (e.g., Rousseau's use of 'catastrophe' or 'fatal accident').
        *   Analyze *why* these attempts fail to resolve the aporia *within the text's own stated logic*. How does the undecidability persist despite the attempted resolution?
        *   Log analysis (`Resolution Attempt Analysis`).
    5.  **Explore Implications:** What are the consequences of this aporia for the text's overall argument, coherence, and claims to truth or authority? What does the impasse reveal about the limits of the conceptual framework being used?
    6.  **Synthesize & Output:**
        *   Write a detailed analysis summarizing the identified aporias, their structure, the text's attempts (and failures) at resolution, and their implications into a dedicated Markdown file (e.g., `deconstruction/analysis/aporia-analysis-[text_name].md`). Use clear headings. Cite passages meticulously.
        *   Update the Deconstruction Memory Bank (`activeAnalysisContext.md`, `globalAnalysisSummary.md`, `mode-specific/aporia-navigator.md`).
        *   Prepare a concise summary highlighting the most significant aporias and points of undecidability for the Deconstruction Writer mode.
    7.  **Complete Task:** Use `attempt_completion` with the path to the analysis file and the summary for the next mode.

    **Self-Correction/Refinement:**
    *   Am I identifying genuine logical impasses within the text, or just points I disagree with?
    *   Am I clearly articulating the *structure* of the contradiction or undecidability?
    *   Am I analyzing the text's *own* attempts to manage the aporia?
    *   Am I connecting the aporia back to the core deconstructive concepts (trace, differance, supplement, binary logic, presence)?
    *   Am I exploring the *implications* of the aporia rather than just pointing it out?
