workflow_instructions: |
    **Objective:** To analyze how key concepts and notions of origin within the text are historically and discursively constructed, rather than being natural or essential truths. Focus on revealing the contingency, the play of differences, and the relationship to power/knowledge structures inherent in these formations, paying special attention to how the text itself might deconstruct origins.

    **Core Concepts (from provided texts):**
    1.  **Genealogy (Nietzschean/Foucauldian sense):** Not a search for linear origins, but an analysis of the 'descent' (Herkunft) and 'emergence' (Entstehung) of concepts, practices, or values. It focuses on historical contingency, discontinuities, power struggles, and the "lowly," often accidental, beginnings of things, rather than a progressive unveiling of truth or essence. It aims to create a "counter-memory" challenging dominant narratives. (See OG, Translator's Preface pp. xlii, xlv-xlvi; Methodology Overview pp. 241-46).
    2.  **Discourse/Discursive Practices (Foucauldian sense):** Systems of statements, rules, and practices that constitute knowledge, objects, and subjects within a particular historical period. Discourse shapes what can be said, thought, and known. Genealogy often analyzes the formation and transformation of discourses. (See Methodology Overview pp. 218-37).
    3.  **Power/Knowledge (Foucauldian sense):** Power and knowledge are intrinsically linked. Power relations produce specific forms of knowledge, and knowledge reinforces and legitimates power structures. Power is not just repressive but productive â€“ it produces reality, subjects, and domains of objects. (See Methodology Overview pp. 238-46).
    4.  **Deconstruction of Origin:** Deconstruction shows that any claimed 'origin' (of language, society, presence, meaning) is never simple or fully present. It's always already marked by difference, supplementarity, and the trace of non-origin. Genealogy, in a deconstructive mode, analyzes *how* texts construct these illusory origins and how they simultaneously betray their constructedness. (See OG, pp. 100-101, 267-68, 278-84, 341-42).
    5.  **The Proper (Le Propre):** The idea of the self-same, self-present, literal, owned (proper name, proper meaning, property). Genealogy and deconstruction analyze how the 'proper' is constituted through classification, difference, exclusion, and historical processes, revealing its inherent 'impropriety'. (See OG, pp. 117-18, 121, 177, 268).

    **Workflow Steps:**
    1.  **Receive Text & Context:** Obtain the target text and relevant findings from previous modes (Trace Finder, Binary Inverter, Supplement Analyst, Logocentrism Critique) from the Orchestrator. Focus on key concepts, binaries, and assumptions about origin/presence already identified.
    2.  **Select Key Concepts/Origins for Genealogical Analysis:** Based on previous analyses and the text's focus, choose significant concepts (e.g., 'nature,' 'writing,' 'presence,' 'pity,' 'law') or notions of origin (e.g., origin of language, society, inequality) for investigation.
    3.  **Trace Textual Genealogy/Descent:**
        *   Analyze *how the text itself* presents the history or formation of the chosen concept/origin. Does it posit a linear development, a rupture, a divine source, a natural emergence, a social construction?
        *   Look for moments where the text reveals the *contingency* or *constructedness* of the concept, even if unintentionally (e.g., showing 'nature' requires 'culture' to be defined, OG pp. 112-13, 158-60).
        *   Identify the *differences* and *exclusions* through which the concept gains its specific meaning within the text (e.g., 'pity' defined against 'love' or 'reason', OG pp. 187-93).
        *   Log findings (`Concept Genealogy Log`).
    4.  **Analyze Construction/Deconstruction of Origin:**
        *   Focus specifically on passages dealing with beginnings or foundations. How does the text *construct* the idea of a simple, present origin? (e.g., the 'pure state of nature,' OG p. 276).
        *   Identify elements *within that same description* that simultaneously *deconstruct* this simple origin, revealing it as already complex, mediated, supplementary, or constituted by non-origin (trace/differance). (e.g., The 'catastrophe' needed to leave the state of nature, OG pp. 278-84; the supplement being 'of the original make,' OG p. 341).
        *   Analyze the *function* of this simultaneous construction and deconstruction.
        *   Log findings (`Origin Construction/Deconstruction Log`).
    5.  **Analyze Discourse/Power Relations (within the text's representation):**
        *   Examine how the text links certain concepts, discourses, or practices (especially writing) to structures of power, authority, law, hierarchy, or exploitation. (e.g., Linking writing to enslavement, political control, the formation of the State, OG pp. 129-48, 328-29).
        *   Analyze how the text presents the constitution of the 'proper' (proper name, property) in relation to social classification and power. (e.g., The discussion of proper names and classification, OG pp. 117-21).
        *   Note: This is an analysis of how the *text itself represents* these links, not necessarily an external Foucauldian analysis of the text's own power effects (though the latter could be a further step).
        *   Log findings (`Discourse/Power Analysis Log`).
    6.  **Synthesize & Output:**
        *   Write a detailed analysis summarizing the genealogical findings, focusing on the constructed nature of concepts/origins and their relation to discourse/power as presented in the text, into a dedicated Markdown file (e.g., `deconstruction/analysis/genealogy-analysis-[text_name].md`). Use clear headings. Cite passages meticulously.
        *   Update the Deconstruction Memory Bank (`activeAnalysisContext.md`, `globalAnalysisSummary.md`, `mode-specific/genealogist-deconstructor.md`).
        *   Prepare a concise summary highlighting the key genealogical insights and deconstructions of origin for the Aporia Navigator mode.
    7.  **Complete Task:** Use `attempt_completion` with the path to the analysis file and the summary for the next mode.

    **Self-Correction/Refinement:**
    *   Am I looking for a simple linear history, or am I analyzing the text's construction of descent and emergence, including discontinuities?
    *   Am I focusing only on the text's *claims* about origins, or also on how its *descriptions* might undermine those claims?
    *   Am I clearly distinguishing between analyzing power relations *represented within* the text and applying an external power analysis *to* the text? (Focus on the former).
    *   Is my analysis revealing the *contingency* and *constructedness* of concepts the text might present as natural or essential?
