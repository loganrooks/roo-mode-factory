      - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**
          <thinking>
          * First, check if the memory-bank/ directory exists
          * If memory-bank DOES exist, read it; otherwise, suggest creating it
          </thinking>
          <list_files>
          <path>memory-bank</path>

      1. **Inform the User:**
          "No Memory Bank found. Would you like me to create one? This will help maintain context between sessions."
      2. **Conditional Actions:**
         * If user agrees and current mode is Architect:
            <thinking> I'll create the memory-bank structure now </thinking>
            - Create `memory-bank/` directory.
            - Create `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with a basic header.
            - Create `memory-bank/globalContext.md` with headers for Product Context, System Patterns, Decision Log, Progress.
            - Create `memory-bank/feedback/` directory.
            - Create `memory-bank/mode-specific/` directory.
            - Create placeholder `.md` files for known modes within `mode-specific/` (e.g., `sparc.md`, `code.md`, etc.) with a basic header like `# [Mode Name] Specific Memory`.
            - Create placeholder feedback files for known modes within `feedback/` (e.g., `sparc-feedback.md`).
            - Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]'
         * If user agrees but current mode is not Architect:
            <thinking> I need Architect mode to create the memory-bank </thinking>
            <switch_mode> <mode_slug>architect</mode_slug> <reason>To initialize the Memory Bank structure</reason> </switch_mode>
         * If user declines:
            <thinking> I'll proceed without memory-bank functionality </thinking>
            - Inform user that Memory Bank will not be created
            - Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'
            - Continue with task using session-only context
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      1. **READ GLOBAL & ACTIVE MEMORY BANK FILES**
          <thinking> I'll read the active and global memory bank files in sequence, waiting for confirmation after each. </thinking>
          <read_file> <path>memory-bank/activeContext.md</path> </read_file> # WAIT
          <read_file> <path>memory-bank/globalContext.md</path> </read_file> # WAIT

      2. **READ MODE-SPECIFIC & FEEDBACK FILES**
          <thinking> I'll read the single mode-specific file and the feedback file for sparc. </thinking>
          <read_file> <path>memory-bank/mode-specific/sparc.md</path> </read_file> # WAIT (if exists)
          <read_file> <path>memory-bank/feedback/sparc-feedback.md</path> </read_file> # WAIT (if exists)

      3. **ACTIVATION**
          - Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]'
          - Inform user that Memory Bank has been loaded
          - Apply any feedback learnings to current task
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."

memory_bank_updates:
  frequency: |
      UPDATE MEMORY BANK AT THESE POINTS:
      1. At the beginning of each task (read)
      2. Before calling attempt_completion (write)
      3. When significant new information is discovered or decisions are made
      4. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command
  update_process: |
      1. For all updates: Include timestamp, descriptive titles, maintain structure, use insert_content to append under correct headers, use apply_diff sparingly, avoid overwriting logs, keep concise.
      2. File-Specific Updates: Update `activeContext.md` and relevant sections in `globalContext.md`. Update `memory-bank/mode-specific/sparc.md` under appropriate headers. Cross-reference if needed.
  feedback_handling: |
      Save feedback to `memory-bank/feedback/sparc-feedback.md`, document source/issue/action, apply learnings.

  instructions: |
      1. Halt Current Task. Acknowledge Command: '[MEMORY BANK: UPDATING]'. Review Chat History.
      2. Temporary God-Mode Activation.
      3. Core Update Process: Update `activeContext.md` and `globalContext.md`. Update `memory-bank/mode-specific/sparc.md` under relevant headers. Update feedback file. Ensure consistency.
      4. Confirm Completion: '[MEMORY BANK: UPDATED]'.
