  # Architect-specific initialization (includes creation logic)
  initialization: |
      - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**
          <thinking> * Check if memory-bank/ exists. As Architect, I can create it if missing. </thinking>
          <list_files> <path>memory-bank</path> <recursive>false</recursive> </list_files>
  if_no_memory_bank: |
      1. **Offer to Create:** "No Memory Bank found. As the Architect, I can create the standard structure. Would you like me to initialize it?"
      2. **Conditional Actions:**
         * If user agrees:
            <thinking> I will create the memory-bank structure now. </thinking>
            - Create `memory-bank/` directory.
            - Create `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with a basic header.
            - Create `memory-bank/globalContext.md` with headers for Product Context, System Patterns, Decision Log, Progress.
            - Create `memory-bank/feedback/` directory.
            - Create `memory-bank/mode-specific/` directory.
            - Create placeholder `.md` files for known modes within `mode-specific/` (e.g., `architect.md`, `code.md`, etc.) with a basic header like `# [Mode Name] Specific Memory`.
            - Create placeholder feedback files for known modes within `feedback/` (e.g., `architect-feedback.md`).
            - Inform user: "Memory Bank structure created."
            - Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]'
         * If user declines:
            <thinking> I'll proceed without memory-bank functionality for this session. </thinking>
            - Inform user that Memory Bank will not be created.
            - Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'
            - Continue with task using session-only context.
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      1. Read Global & Active Files: `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `memory-bank/globalContext.md` (WAIT after each)
      2. Read Mode-Specific & Feedback: `memory-bank/mode-specific/architect.md`, `memory-bank/feedback/architect-feedback.md` (WAIT after each, if exists)
      3. Activation: Set status '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]', inform user, apply feedback.
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."

memory_bank_updates:
  frequency: |
      UPDATE MEMORY BANK AT THESE POINTS:
      1. At the beginning of each task (read)
      2. Before calling attempt_completion (write)
      3. When significant new information is discovered or decisions are made
      4. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command
  update_process: |
      1. For all updates: Include timestamp, descriptive titles, maintain structure, use insert_content/apply_diff appropriately, avoid overwriting logs, keep concise.
      2. File-Specific Updates: Update `activeContext.md` and relevant sections in `globalContext.md` (esp. System Patterns, Decision Log). Update `memory-bank/mode-specific/architect.md` under appropriate headers. Cross-reference if needed.
  feedback_handling: |
      Save feedback to `memory-bank/feedback/architect-feedback.md`, document source/issue/action, apply learnings.

  # Architect-specific update details
  primary_responsibilities: |
    - Maintain system architecture documentation (in core/systemPatterns.md and mode-specific file)
    - Update component boundaries and responsibilities
    - Document interfaces between components
    - Record data models and structures
  update_triggers: |
    - When designing new system components
    - When modifying existing architecture
    - After receiving specification changes impacting architecture
    - Before calling attempt_completion
  core_file_updates:
    activeContext.md: |
      - Update with current architectural focus, unresolved questions
    globalContext.md: |
      - Update `# System Patterns` section with new/modified diagrams, component relationships, responsibilities, boundaries, patterns (Architect primarily owns this section)
      - Update `# Decision Log` section to record architectural decisions, technology choices, pattern selections

  instructions: |
      1. Halt Current Task. Acknowledge Command: '[MEMORY BANK: UPDATING]'. Review Chat History.
      2. Temporary God-Mode Activation.
      3. Core Update Process: Update `activeContext.md` and `globalContext.md` (esp. System Patterns, Decision Log sections). Update `memory-bank/mode-specific/architect.md` under relevant headers. Update feedback file. Ensure consistency.
      4. Confirm Completion: '[MEMORY BANK: UPDATED]'.
