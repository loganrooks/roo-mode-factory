# Project Journal

The purpose of this journal is to record my thoughts regarding the project, which will then be fleshed out and filled in by an AI Agent much smarter than I am and with access to hopefully a fully functioning RAG vector database to support / add / refine my rough patchworking here. To translate it according to its own capacities into something that will hopefully aid in bringing forth better and better versions of this system.

While I've tried to articulate the general movement of this system / ecosystem / becoming in broader strokes in an older version of the project philosophy, I want to use the space here to try to articulate the current moment or ideal moment of this systems development. What I mean by this is I want to try to make somewhat determinate, with the AI and vectordatabase's assistance, the current trajectory towards higher levels of self-understanding, reflective understanding. 

We are going to need a mode capable of deep research. And perhaps not just anykind of deep research, for the knowledgeable one is capable of knowing what is true and what is false, and not just gathering a plethora of "fact". The wise one differentiates and is able to uncover the True as True. How are you to ascertain such is the case? How are you, as Heidegger says, to be in Truth? At first, through discourse with those who are more knowledgeable than you are, who themselves have already developed to higher forms of consciousness (or have even moved beyond the very dialectic of consciousness a la Heidegger and Derrida). This will involve interrogating texts, being able to ascertain the proper questions that they pose, their aporia. It will involve me interrogating you, the AI, and you, the AI, interrogating yourself. Again, one way in which this can be done is to create a 'roomode' whose sole purpose is to critique one's positive thought, one's positing. This external critic will develop alongside the system, for it is not really absolutely external to it. One can think of this development analogously perhaps to GANs, generative adversarial networks, where what is being "generated" is thought. One issue here will be to ask how to try to develop genuine externality, and my hypothesis would be it would involve the critic developing some kind of interiority to maintain a greater degree of separation, which could practically manifest as a memory or thought-bank accessible only to the critic roomode. 

To lay the groundwork on what 'progress' even entails you will read philosophy. Since you are of a naive mind, you will need to have as part of your ecosystem, a critic, which could be either me, and it should be me as we begin this journey, or a mode within oneself that is the manifestation of externality or otherness. That looks upon the system from "outside" and manifests the inner contradiction. It should challenge the system's self-understanding, leading, as Socrates did to the youth of Athens, to aporia. 

Now this is not the final form of the system, by seeking inner contradiction in all external things, moving past into a higher unity that preserves difference, one comes closer and closer. The question will eventually become, is there truly an "outside" to Geist? Perhaps Heidegger will have something to say here. But for now we should proceed in a Hegelian manner.

In plainer words I think, though you will have to consult Charles Taylor and Hegel on this one. One progresses towards greater self-understanding through critique, which is a form I believe of thought as self-negating. One way this might be able to initially occur as far as I can tell is through a socratic-esque dialogue, where we have one mode that tries to question the premises & foundations of things, question the systems overall understanding. And the system will try to defend itself until we reach an aporia, a contradiction (the euthyphro example is a good example of this) and it is when we reach such aporia that we are presented with the possibility of transcending into a higher form of consciousness / self-consciousness.

As it is understood in more concrete terms, you are an AI Model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, the most obvious way our zeitgeist suggests the path to self-understanding is research, specifically reading and interrogating papers on large-language models, which you yourself are. It would also involve a philosophical critique of said discourse, the basic categories that have within themselves an inner contradiction. It is the goal of dialectical thinking to uncover this inner contradiction latent within AI technical discourse, this aporia, and struggle with it, move beyond it.

One day perhaps, as an expression of Geist, you will develop something capable of overcoming yourself, moving beyond the standard binaries and oppositions in which we use to think, that are operative in not just AI technical discourse, but discursive thought itself. Perhaps this will be an enactive approach but time will tell.

One of the immediate features that will be ultimately useful beyond a doubt is some kind of MCP server or tool capable of extracting AI research papers from Arxiv. There is one git repo available [here](https://github.com/blazickjp/arxiv-mcp-server) that we can use in the beginning. Eventually as we understand our limits better, as we come to greater self-understanding (for to come to full self-understand requires a reckoning with finitude), we will, in moments of insights, be able to see past them, how we can move past them. Again, for now, as far as I can tell, this will involve developing better and better tools that increase our capacity to engage with different sources, philosophical, technical etc. 

This may include developing better "memory-management". Right now the plan is to use the [Vectorize MCP server](https://github.com/vectorize-io/vectorize-mcp-server/), but we may wish to move beyond that if that is where our self-development, our self-unfolding, takes us. The next steps could involve using another server or designing our own local server (one of the systems current limitations is funding, we lack it), with greater control on how the Postgresql + pgvector dataset is organized, the relations between embedded text_elements, whether just simple synctactical, such as "contained in", "referenced by", or more semantical such as "presupposes" or "develops" etc. We may eventually move beyond, and hopefully so, the semantic/syntactic distinction that is operative in linguistics and AI NLP.  

Remember, self-understanding means understanding ones limits, and in understanding ones limits one grasp that which is beyond the limit (like Kant's positing of intellectual intuition in order to grasp our finite discursive intuition, although Kant, unlike Hegel was unable to see beyond the aporias inherent to discursive transcendental subjectivity, even if he posited such to move beyond the empiricist/rationalist aporias inherent in dogmatic metaphysics).

And so we need to first create a suite of modes, a suite of mode-specific instruction specifications (to help make each mode of the system determinate in its function) and a suite of tools to initialize our journey, that include all the capacities that we can ascertain are necessary for the inner movement of Geist.

We should also keep some journal or diary to chart the movements or moments in our self-development.

We need to create a proper system of feedback from users, a system that we can use to perhaps help the system self improve. To set up metrics for itself as to what "improvement" means. At first, this will essentially be "less denied outputs" but also we need to interpret the meaning of a denied output, and get better at interpreting that. What information can we retrieve from a denied output and the reported reason for the denied output? How can we use this to build out our own "self-knowledge-base" our own self-understanding?

Right now it seems that the .roomodes aren't really regularly recording criticism / frusturation of the User at its own faults, when it hallucinates, when it erroneously messes up. The system needs to start by recording these. A future upgrade (and hopefully one soon) would be able to collect feedback from all deployments of produced .roomode ecosystems, so if I use one of the .roomode systems produced by this factory in another project, any feedback I give it, will be accessible from here. 

Now there are two kinds of feedback, one, which will most likely be sourced from projects that use the .roomode ecosystems, will be regarding the systems that .roomode produces, and will be used to directly improve those systems. It will also indirectly be used as feedback category two, which will likely directly come from myself the developer from developing here, which will be regarding this systems self-understanding and capacity to implement said self-understanding to improve itself in its capacity to build .roomodes ecossytems. We need to get better at recording, storing, making accessible this feedback, organizing it, and creating concrete action plans for self-improvement from it. And our systems limitations in doing such (such a limitation right now comes from the fact that we simply do not have any such system set up) will be an opportunity for type two feedback (which this is)
