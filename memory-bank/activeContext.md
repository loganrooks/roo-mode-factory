## [2025-04-10 17:24:09] - Task Start: Test RAG Ingestion Pipeline
- **Objective:** Verify `pipelines/rag_ingestion.py` processing of generated EPUB, artifact removal, and TOC preservation.
- **Steps:** Generate EPUB -> Run Pipeline -> Verify Output -> Report.

## [2025-04-10 17:37:24] - Task Update: RAG Pipeline Test Final Outcome
- **Outcome:** Test Failed.
  - Root Cause: `testing/utils/epub_generator.py` produced an invalid EPUB missing chapter content files (`chap_01.xhtml`, `chap_02.xhtml`) despite referencing them.
  - Pipeline Behavior: `pipelines/rag_ingestion.py` correctly identified missing items and produced no content, as expected with invalid input.
  - Pipeline Script State: Changes reverted; script restored to original spine-based logic.
- **Next:** Report findings via `attempt_completion`. Recommend fixing the generator.

## [2025-04-10 17:25:46] - Task Update: RAG Pipeline Test Results
- **Outcome:** Partial Success.
  - Step 1 (EPUB Gen): Success.
  - Step 2 (Pipeline Run): Failed initially (`NameError`), fixed, then Success.
  - Step 3 (Verification): Partially successful. TOC present but duplicated/incorrectly formatted. Artifact removal verification incomplete due to `read_file` issue (only read 12 lines).
- **Next:** Report results via `attempt_completion`.
