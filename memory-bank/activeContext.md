## [2025-04-15 21:54:00] - Architect - Task Complete: Philosophical Assistant Architecture Design
- **Status:** Completed design based on provided documents (`project_journal.md`, `project_philosophy.md`, RAG docs, methodology docs, etc.).
- **Deliverables:** Created `docs/philosophy_assistant_architecture.md` detailing modes, RAG, MCP servers, interactions, and philosophical integration. Prepared Memory Bank updates.
- **Next:** Call `attempt_completion`.

## [2025-04-10 17:24:09] - Task Start: Test RAG Ingestion Pipeline
## [2025-04-10 18:44:15] - Task Start: Implement `acquire_epub.py`
- **Objective:** Create Python script for Zlibrary EPUB search and download based on `docs/adr-001-zlibrary-epub-acquisition.md`.
- **Inputs:** ADR, `sertraline/zlibrary`, `.env` credentials.
- **Outputs:** `pipelines/acquire_epub.py`, updated `requirements.txt`, placeholder `.env`.
- **Steps:** Read ADR -> Update requirements -> Create `.env` -> Implement script -> Update Memory Bank -> Complete.

## [2025-04-10 18:45:35] - Task Update: `acquire_epub.py` Implementation
- **Status:** Script implemented (`pipelines/acquire_epub.py`), dependencies added (`requirements.txt`), placeholder `.env` created.
- **Notes:** Implementation based on ADR-001, using `sertraline-zlib` (assumed name), `aiohttp`, `dotenv`, `argparse`. Includes basic search, interactive selection, and download logic. Key library interactions (login, download URL retrieval) are based on assumptions and require testing/validation.
- **Next:** Update remaining Memory Bank files and call `attempt_completion`.


## [2025-04-10 18:51:10] - Task Update: Correction of `acquire_epub.py`
- **Status:** Initial implementation attempt rejected due to incorrect assumptions about `sertraline/zlibrary`.
- **Action:** Investigated library via web search and README analysis. Corrected package name (`zlibrary`), imports, login method, search syntax, and download URL retrieval logic in `pipelines/acquire_epub.py` and `requirements.txt`.
- **Current State:** Script rewritten based on verified library usage.
- **Next:** Update remaining Memory Bank files and call `attempt_completion`.



- **Objective:** Verify `pipelines/rag_ingestion.py` processing of generated EPUB, artifact removal, and TOC preservation.
- **Steps:** Generate EPUB -> Run Pipeline -> Verify Output -> Report.

## [2025-04-10 17:37:24] - Task Update: RAG Pipeline Test Final Outcome
- **Outcome:** Test Failed.
  - Root Cause: `testing/utils/epub_generator.py` produced an invalid EPUB missing chapter content files (`chap_01.xhtml`, `chap_02.xhtml`) despite referencing them.
  - Pipeline Behavior: `pipelines/rag_ingestion.py` correctly identified missing items and produced no content, as expected with invalid input.
  - Pipeline Script State: Changes reverted; script restored to original spine-based logic.
- **Next:** Report findings via `attempt_completion`. Recommend fixing the generator.

## [2025-04-10 17:25:46] - Task Update: RAG Pipeline Test Results
- **Outcome:** Partial Success.
  - Step 1 (EPUB Gen): Success.
  - Step 2 (Pipeline Run): Failed initially (`NameError`), fixed, then Success.
  - Step 3 (Verification): Partially successful. TOC present but duplicated/incorrectly formatted. Artifact removal verification incomplete due to `read_file` issue (only read 12 lines).
- **Next:** Report results via `attempt_completion`.
