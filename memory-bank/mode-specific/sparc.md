Re-delegated bash script creation (Attempt 2) to `code` mode, incorporating the optional output format flag.
Re-delegated bash script creation to `code` mode. User provided feedback requesting an optional output format flag (e.g., for `.txt`).
Delegated modification of `pipelines/rag_ingestion.py` to `code` mode.
The `code` mode successfully created `process_epubs.sh` with the `-f` flag. Noted that `pipelines/rag_ingestion.py` needs modification to accept a full output path.
User provided feedback on completion attempt, requesting focus shift to Zlibrary integration for source acquisition.
Architecture / Specification (Zlibrary Integration)
The `code` mode successfully updated the script to accept a full output path.
Delegated architectural design for Zlibrary integration to `architect` mode.
Architecture / Specification (Zlibrary Integration)
Architect mode completed the design, recommending a standalone Python script (`acquire_epub.py`) using `sertraline/zlibrary`. Documented in `docs/adr-001-zlibrary-epub-acquisition.md`.
Delegated implementation of Zlibrary acquisition script (`acquire_epub.py`) to `code` mode.
Testing (Pipeline Execution - Attempt 2 Failed - Incorrect Mode)
`code` mode investigated the `sertraline/zlibrary` library, corrected implementation based on findings, created `pipelines/acquire_epub.py`, updated `requirements.txt`, and documented findings in `docs/zlibrary_api_notes.md`.
