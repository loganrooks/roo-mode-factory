# Architect Feedback Log


## [2025-04-15 22:10:00] - User Intervention: Incorporate ZLibrary MCP & PhilPapers
- **Source:** User feedback during task execution.
- **Issue/Task:** Initial architecture design did not explicitly leverage the existing ZLibrary MCP or make PhilPapers access essential.
- **Action/Learning:**
    - Received user feedback specifying the availability and capabilities of the ZLibrary MCP (including RAG processing) and the requirement for PhilPapers access.
    - Revised the architecture document (`docs/philosophy_assistant_architecture.md`) and corresponding Memory Bank entries (`globalContext.md`, `mode-specific/architect.md`) to:
        - Utilize `ZLibrary-MCP` for book acquisition and initial processing in the ingestion pipeline.
        - Remove the proposed `Ingestion-MCP` as its function is largely covered by `ZLibrary-MCP`.
        - Designate the `PhilAPI-MCP` as essential, specifically for PhilPapers access.
        - Update diagrams and component descriptions accordingly.
- **Feedback:** User intervention was crucial for incorporating existing infrastructure (ZLibrary MCP) and clarifying external API priorities (PhilPapers). This highlights the importance of confirming available tools/servers early in the design process.


## [2025-04-15 21:54:00] - Philosophical Research Assistant Architecture Design Task
- **Source:** Task completion.
- **Issue/Task:** Design architecture for a multi-mode RooCode system for philosophical research, incorporating RAG, critique, discourse, and external APIs, based on provided documentation.
- **Action/Learning:**
    - Analyzed `project_journal.md`, `project_philosophy.md`, RAG docs, methodology overview, API access doc, and MCP guide.
    - Synthesized requirements into a multi-mode architecture (`Philosopher`, `Researcher`, `Critic`, `Librarian`).
    - Defined RAG system based on `roocode-rag-research-assistant.md`, recommending a custom `DB-MCP`.
    - Proposed optional `PhilAPI-MCP` and `Ingestion-MCP` for abstraction and pipeline management.
    - Integrated philosophical concepts (critique, discourse, methodologies) into mode responsibilities.
    - Adapted Memory Bank structure with research-specific files.
    - Created architecture document `docs/philosophy_assistant_architecture.md` with Mermaid diagram.
- **Challenges:** Integrating the diverse philosophical goals (critique, self-understanding) with the technical RAG implementation required careful consideration of mode responsibilities and interactions. Managing the complexity of the ingestion pipeline (dependencies, environment) led to recommending an optional dedicated `Ingestion-MCP`. Balancing the detail from the RAG document with the broader philosophical aims was key.
- **Feedback:** The provided documentation, especially `roocode-rag-research-assistant.md`, was highly detailed and useful for the RAG component design. The philosophical documents provided essential direction for the mode structure and behavior.

## [2025-04-10 18:38:00] - Z-Library Integration Architecture Design

**Task:** Design architecture for acquiring EPUBs from Z-Library for the RAG pipeline.

**Design Rationale & Decisions:**

1.  **Chosen Approach:** Standalone Python script (`acquire_epub.py`) utilizing the `sertraline/zlibrary` library.
2.  **Reasoning:**
    *   Leverages existing unofficial library with relevant features (auth, search, filters, proxy support).
    *   Integrates well with the existing Python-based RAG pipeline.
    *   Avoids the initial overhead of building/maintaining a dedicated MCP server, while remaining modular enough for potential future refactoring.
    *   Simpler than direct web scraping.
3.  **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   **MCP Server:** Deemed overkill for initial implementation but a viable option if complexity increases (e.g., advanced anti-blocking, shared service needs).
    *   **Bash Script:** Less robust for handling API interactions, authentication, error handling, and potential async operations compared to Python.
    *   **Direct Scraping:** More brittle and complex than using an existing (albeit unofficial) library.

**Trade-offs:**

*   **Dependency on Unofficial Library:** The main risk is `sertraline/zlibrary` breaking due to Z-Library changes. Mitigation involves pinning versions, monitoring the repo, and robust error handling.
*   **Download Authorization Complexity:** Ensuring the download request uses the login session requires careful implementation.
*   **Interactive Selection:** Current design requires user input; full automation would need different selection logic.

**Potential Challenges & Risks:**

*   **Anti-Scraping Measures:** Rate limits, IP blocks, CAPTCHAs remain a significant risk despite proxy support. Requires careful implementation of delays and error handling.
*   **Library Maintenance:** `sertraline/zlibrary` might become unmaintained.
*   **Legal/Ethical Concerns:** Automating downloads from Z-Library carries inherent legal/ethical risks related to copyright. Use must be responsible.
*   **Session Handling for Downloads:** Technical detail requiring verification during implementation.

**Overall:** The standalone script approach using the library provides a pragmatic balance of functionality and implementation effort for the current requirements.
