### [%%current_timestamp%%] - PhilAPI-MCP Refactoring Feedback
- **Source:** Task Completion & Test Verification
- **Issue:** Server (`main.py`) and test (`test_philapi_mcp.py`) code functional but lacked optimal clarity, comments, and structure post-TDD GREEN phase. `apply_diff` initially failed partially due to content shift, requiring re-read and re-apply. Syntax errors in dummy SDK classes were introduced and fixed.
- **Action:** Refactored `main.py` (docstrings, type hints, comments, constants, removed dead code). Refactored `test_philapi_mcp.py` (comments, variable names, clarified `importlib` workaround). Verified all 8 tests passed after each significant change and at the end using `pytest`. Refactoring successful.


### [%%current_timestamp%%] - DB-MCP Refactoring Feedback

- **Issue:** Initial code functional but could be improved for clarity and maintainability post-TDD GREEN phase.
- **Action:** Refactored `main.py` (type hints, comments, var names) and `test_db_mcp.py` (helper function, test renaming). Verified all 21 tests passed after each significant change and at the end using `pytest`. Refactoring successful.
