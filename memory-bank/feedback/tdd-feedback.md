# TDD Mode Feedback Log

*This log tracks feedback received, issues encountered, and learnings related to the TDD mode.*

## [2025-04-10 17:41:15] - New Task: Fix EPUB Generator & Re-test
- **User Request:** Attempt to fix `testing/utils/epub_generator.py` to include chapter content files correctly and then re-run the full RAG pipeline test.
- **Source:** User feedback on `attempt_completion`.
- **Action:** Analyze generator script, apply fix, re-execute test steps (Generate -> Pipeline -> Verify).

## [2025-04-10 17:36:29] - CRITICAL CORRECTION - Root Cause Identified
- **User Feedback:** Clarified that `chap_01.xhtml` and `chap_02.xhtml` were *never* included in the generated EPUB (`test_pipeline.epub`). Only `nav.xhtml` existed.
- **Revised Understanding:** The root cause is `testing/utils/epub_generator.py` creating an invalid/incomplete EPUB, not a pipeline processing error for valid content. The pipeline correctly found no content to process.
- **Impact:** Previous pipeline code changes (switching to manifest-based processing) were based on a misunderstanding and should be reverted.
- **Source:** User feedback during error investigation.
- **Action:** Revert changes to `pipelines/rag_ingestion.py`. Address the issue in `testing/utils/epub_generator.py`.

## [2025-04-10 17:31:57] - User Feedback on Test Report
- **Feedback:** Test completion rejected. Test was a complete failure as output file (`test_pipeline.rag.md`) only contained 12 lines (TOC sections), missing main body content. `read_file` issue was a misinterpretation; the file *was* truncated by the pipeline.
- **Provided Info:** Content of `nav.xhtml` from test EPUB.
- **Source:** User feedback on `attempt_completion`.
- **Action:** Re-evaluate pipeline failure. Investigate why main content (`chap_01.xhtml`, `chap_02.xhtml`) was not processed, likely related to spine/manifest warnings during execution. Update test result status to FAIL.

## [2025-04-10 17:25:33] - Verification Difficulty
- **Issue:** `read_file` tool consistently returned only the first 12 lines of the output file (`library/rag-output/test_pipeline.rag.md`), even when requesting the full file.
- **Impact:** Prevented full verification of artifact removal from the main content body.
- **Source:** Task: Test RAG Ingestion Pipeline (Step 3).
- **Action:** Reporting test results based on partial verification. Further investigation needed into `read_file` behavior or potential file truncation.

## [2025-04-10 17:24:35] - RAG Pipeline Test Failure
- **Issue:** `execute_command` for `pipelines/rag_ingestion.py` failed (Exit Code 1).
- **Error:** `NameError: name 'process_epub_to_rag_markdown' is not defined` at line 405.
- **Source:** Task: Test RAG Ingestion Pipeline (Step 2).
- **Action:** Need to inspect `pipelines/rag_ingestion.py` to fix the function call/definition before re-running the test.
