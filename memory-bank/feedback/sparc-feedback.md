# SPARC Orchestrator Feedback Log

## Session: 2025-04-10
### [2025-04-16 06:32 PM] Feedback on Script TDD RED Phase (`chunk_embed_store.py`)
- **Source:** `tdd` mode execution result.
- **Outcome:** `tdd` mode successfully created `testing/scripts/test_chunk_embed_store.py` with initial failing tests (stubs) and `testing/scripts/requirements.txt` based on specifications. Tests cover argument parsing, file I/O, chunking, embedding, MCP client interaction, output, and exit codes, using mocks.
- **Status:** TDD RED phase for `scripts/chunk_embed_store.py` is complete.


### [2025-04-16 06:27 PM] Feedback on Script Implementation (`chunk_embed_store.py`)
- **Source:** `code` mode execution result.
- **Outcome:** `code` mode successfully implemented `scripts/chunk_embed_store.py` and `scripts/requirements.txt` based on specifications. Includes arg parsing, chunking, OpenAI embedding (batched), and conceptual `McpStdioClient` for `DB-MCP` interaction. Tests were not run as per constraints.
- **Status:** Implementation complete, ready for TDD cycle.


### [2025-04-16 06:15 PM] Feedback on PhilAPI-MCP TDD GREEN Phase (Success)
- **Source:** `code` mode execution result.
- **Outcome:** `code` mode successfully implemented `mcp-servers/philapi-mcp/main.py` and `requirements.txt`. Debugged and corrected MCP SDK import/usage issues in both implementation and test files (`testing/mcp-servers/philapi-mcp/test_philapi_mcp.py`). Verified implementation by executing `pytest testing/mcp-servers/philapi-mcp/test_philapi_mcp.py -v` via `execute_command`. **All 8 tests passed.**
- **Status:** TDD GREEN phase for `PhilAPI-MCP` server is complete.


### [2025-04-16 09:00 AM] Feedback on DB-MCP TDD REFACTOR Phase (Success)
- **Source:** `refinement-optimization-mode` execution result.
- **Outcome:** Refactoring of `mcp-servers/db-mcp/main.py` and `testing/mcp-servers/db-mcp/test_db_mcp.py` completed successfully. Changes focused on clarity (type hints, comments, naming) and DRY principles (test helper function). All 21 tests were verified to pass after refactoring using `pytest`.
- **Status:** TDD REFACTOR phase for `DB-MCP` server is complete.


### [2025-04-16 08:52 AM] Feedback on DB-MCP TDD GREEN Phase (Final Verification - Success)
- **Source:** `code` mode execution result.
- **Outcome:** After `code` mode corrected test data vectors and assertion thresholds in `testing/mcp-servers/db-mcp/test_db_mcp.py`, it successfully executed `pytest testing/mcp-servers/db-mcp/test_db_mcp.py -v` via `execute_command`. **All 21 tests passed.**
- **Status:** TDD GREEN phase for `DB-MCP` server is complete.


### [2025-04-16 08:52 AM] Feedback on DB-MCP TDD GREEN Phase (Attempt 4 - Success)
- **Source:** `code` mode execution result.
- **Outcome:** `code` mode successfully corrected test data vectors and assertion thresholds in `testing/mcp-servers/db-mcp/test_db_mcp.py`. Verified fix by executing `pytest testing/mcp-servers/db-mcp/test_db_mcp.py -v` via `execute_command`. **All 21 tests passed.**
- **Status:** TDD GREEN phase for `DB-MCP` server is complete.
- **Learning:** Confirmed the corrected TDD workflow (implementing mode verifies GREEN phase) and the importance of detailed delegation instructions.


### [2025-04-16 08:47 AM] CRITICAL Feedback on SPARC TDD Workflow & Delegation Failures
- **Source:** User feedback during task resumption.
- **Issue 1 (TDD GREEN Phase Responsibility):** SPARC repeatedly failed to assign GREEN phase *verification* (running tests post-fix) to the implementing mode (`code`). Instead, incorrectly delegated verification attempts to `tdd`.
- **Issue 2 (Delegation Detail/Clarity):** Delegations lacked imperative instructions, explicit file paths for context, and sufficient detail overall.
- **Issue 3 (Regression Testing):** Delegations failed to mandate re-running the *entire* relevant test suite after code changes.
- **Issue 4 (Result Detail):** SPARC did not enforce detailed completion reports from modes explaining actions, rationale, and outcomes.
- **Action:** SPARC must immediately correct its TDD workflow understanding and delegation practices. Future delegations *will*:
    - Assign GREEN phase verification (running `pytest` via `execute_command`) to the implementing mode (`code`).
    - Include explicit, imperative instructions to read specific context files.
    - Mandate re-running the full test suite after any code modification.
    - Require detailed completion reports explaining changes, rationale, and test outcomes.


### [2025-04-16 08:42 AM] Feedback on SPARC TDD Workflow & Delegation Clarity
- **Source:** User feedback during task resumption.
- **Issue 1 (TDD GREEN Phase):** SPARC incorrectly delegated GREEN phase *verification* to `tdd` mode. The implementing mode (`code` in this context) should run tests (`pytest` via `execute_command`) and ensure *all* pass before completing.
- **Issue 2 (Proactivity/Detail):** Delegations lack sufficient detail (context, file paths) and don't adequately instruct modes to be proactive (e.g., run tests themselves).
- **Issue 3 (Regression):** Delegations don't explicitly require running *all* relevant tests after changes.
- **Issue 4 (Results):** Mode completion messages lack detail on changes made and rationale.
- **Action:** SPARC will correct the TDD workflow delegation. Future delegations will be more detailed, explicitly instruct modes on proactivity (including running tests), require full test suite runs post-change, and demand comprehensive completion reports.


### [2025-04-16 08:05 AM] Feedback on DB-MCP TDD GREEN Phase (Attempt 2)
- **Source:** `tdd` mode execution result.
- **Issue:** Test execution (`pytest testing/mcp-servers/db-mcp/test_db_mcp.py`) failed again (8 failed, 13 passed) after initial corrections. GREEN phase still incomplete.
- **Details:** Persistent `vector <=> numeric[]` operator error in similarity search tests (likely requires explicit vector casting `::vector` or adapter use in tests). New `CardinalityViolation` error in `test_batch_insert_chunks_duplicate_index_in_batch` indicates `execute_values` with `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` cannot handle duplicates within the same batch.
- **Action:** Test suite (`test_db_mcp.py`) requires further correction for vector casting and handling of intra-batch duplicates. Delegating test code correction (Attempt 2) to `code` mode.


### [2025-04-16 07:57 AM] Feedback on DB-MCP TDD GREEN Phase
- **Source:** `tdd` mode execution result.
- **Issue:** Test execution (`pytest testing/mcp-servers/db-mcp/test_db_mcp.py`) failed (13 failed, 8 passed). GREEN phase incomplete.
- **Details:** Failures primarily due to embedding dimension mismatch (test data: 3D, schema: 1536D) and an operator error (`vector <=> numeric[]`) in `test_query_similar_chunks_zero_results`.
- **Action:** Test suite (`test_db_mcp.py`) requires correction before re-attempting GREEN phase verification. Delegating test code correction to `code` mode.


### [2025-04-16 03:14 AM] Feedback on Mode Proactivity
- **Source:** User feedback during task resumption.
- **Issue:** Modes (including SPARC) have been overly reliant on asking the user to perform actions (like running tests, setting up environments) instead of attempting safe actions themselves using available tools (e.g., `execute_command`).
- **Action:** SPARC will instruct delegated modes to be more proactive, attempt execution of safe commands, research blockers, and only rely on the user for critical decisions, confirmations, or actions requiring manual intervention (like setting secrets or complex environment setup).


### [2025-04-16 02:42 AM] Feedback on SPARC State Management & Prerequisite Check
- **Source:** User feedback.
- **Issue 1:** SPARC attempted to update `activeContext.md` via `insert_content` which failed due to file restrictions, but SPARC did not properly acknowledge or handle this failure before proceeding.
- **Issue 2:** SPARC incorrectly assumed database/environment prerequisites for TDD GREEN phase were met and asked the user to run tests prematurely.
- **Action:** Acknowledging errors. Will ensure Memory Bank update failures are handled correctly and prerequisites are confirmed or delegated for setup before requesting dependent actions.


### [2025-04-16 01:07 AM] Feedback on SPARC Feedback Logging
- **Source:** User denial of `new_task` for `spec-pseudocode` mode.
- **Issue:** SPARC failed to log the previous feedback (regarding needing specs before TDD) *before* proceeding with the corrected delegation. This violates the feedback handling process.
- **Action:** Logging this meta-feedback now. Will ensure feedback is logged immediately upon receipt in the future.


### [2025-04-16 01:05 AM] Feedback on SPARC Workflow (TDD before Spec)
- **Source:** User denial of `new_task` for `tdd` mode.
- **Issue:** SPARC attempted to delegate testing (`tdd` mode) for the `DB-MCP` server *before* ensuring detailed specifications and pseudocode with TDD anchors were created for the server's implementation, violating the standard SPARC workflow (Spec -> Code -> Test).
- **Action:** Halted testing delegation. Will now delegate specification creation for `DB-MCP` to `spec-pseudocode` mode first.



### [~12:07 PM] Feedback on Delegation (Clean MD Task)
- **Source:** User denial of `new_task` for `code` mode.
- **Issue:** Initial delegation lacked instruction for detailed completion summary.
- **Action:** Added requirement for `code` mode to provide a detailed overview of changes/problems in its `attempt_completion` result. Incorporated into subsequent delegation attempts.

### [~12:35 PM] Feedback on Task Approach (Manual Cleaning)
- **Source:** User termination message.
- **Issue:** Manual cleaning of markdown files using agent tools identified as inefficient (time/cost) for the project's scale.
- **Action:** Pivoted task objective from manual cleaning to designing an automated RAG ingestion pipeline. Updated Memory Bank and workflow state.

### [~12:37 PM] Feedback on Specification Delegation (Pipeline Spec v1)
- **Source:** User denial of `new_task` for `spec-pseudocode` mode.
- **Issue:** Initial pipeline specification request didn't emphasize leveraging existing libraries.
- **Action:** Updated delegation instructions to require research and incorporation of public Python EPUB processing libraries.

### [~12:39 PM] Feedback on Specification Delegation (Pipeline Spec v2)
- **Source:** User denial of `new_task` for `spec-pseudocode` mode.
- **Issue:** Pipeline specification request lacked instruction to document the *limitations* of chosen libraries.
- **Action:** Updated delegation instructions to include documenting library limitations for future custom development needs.

### [~12:40 PM] Feedback on Memory Bank Organization
- **Source:** User feedback.
- **Issue:** SPARC mode incorrectly mixed feedback logs and workflow state within `memory-bank/mode-specific/sparc.md`, leading to disorganization. Feedback belongs in `memory-bank/feedback/sparc-feedback.md`.
- **Action:** Reverted incorrect changes to `mode-specific/sparc.md`. Created this feedback file (`memory-bank/feedback/sparc-feedback.md`) to store feedback correctly. Will proceed to fix the structure of `mode-specific/sparc.md`.

### [~12:48 PM] Feedback on Delegation Process (Meta-Level)
- **Source:** User denial of `new_task` for `spec-pseudocode` mode.
- **Issue:** SPARC was not instructing delegated modes (e.g., `spec-pseudocode`) to record their *own* feedback and learnings in their respective feedback files (e.g., `memory-bank/feedback/[mode-slug]-feedback.md`). This violates the core self-improvement philosophy.
- **Action:** SPARC must modify its delegation process. All `new_task` messages should include an explicit instruction for the target mode to maintain its feedback log, recording challenges, learnings, and user interactions related to its task. This will be incorporated into the next delegation attempt.

### [~12:42 PM] Feedback on Mode Selection & Feedback Recording
- **Source:** User feedback.
- **Issue 1:** SPARC mode (Auto-Coder) might not be the most suitable for the task of analyzing Markdown files for artifacts. A mode with stronger text processing or file system capabilities might be better.
- **Issue 2:** SPARC failed to record the previous feedback regarding the need for sub-tasks in its own feedback log.
- **Action:** SPARC needs to be more diligent in recording feedback. SPARC will reconsider the appropriate mode for the analysis task. Consider using `code` mode or potentially a new mode specialized in file analysis if needed.


### [~12:48 PM] Feedback on Task Execution (Pipeline Test - Attempt 3 - Correction)
- **Source:** User feedback.
- **Correction:** My previous assessment was incorrect. The `tdd` mode *did* perform the requested task of creating tests for the EPUB pipeline and reported the coverage increase. The confusion arose from my misinterpretation of the user's intent.
- **Action:** Acknowledge the successful completion of the testing task by the `tdd` mode. Proceed with the next step based on the successful test results.

### [~06:12 PM] Feedback on Task Execution (Pipeline Test - Attempt 3)
- **Source:** User feedback / Incorrect task completion report from `tdd` mode.
- **Issue:** The `tdd` mode, despite explicit instructions to *execute* a specific test scenario using `execute_command` and `read_file`, instead focused on its primary function of writing unit tests and improving code coverage. It failed to perform the requested execution and verification steps.
- **Action:** SPARC must re-delegate the execution task *again*, potentially still to `tdd` (as it's the closest fit for verification), but with extreme emphasis on *only* performing the requested `execute_command` and `read_file` steps and reporting those specific results. Forbid writing new tests for this specific execution task.

### [~05:22 PM] Feedback on Mode Assignment (Testing Task)
- **Source:** User feedback.
- **Issue:** SPARC incorrectly assigned the task of testing the RAG pipeline (generating test data, executing the pipeline, verifying output) to the `code` mode multiple times. This violates the SPARC principle of assigning tasks to the appropriate specialized mode (`tdd` for testing).
- **Action:** SPARC must delegate testing tasks to the `tdd` mode. Correct the workflow state and re-delegate the pipeline test task to the `tdd` mode.

### [~05:21 PM] Feedback on Task Execution (Pipeline Test - Attempt 2)
- **Source:** User feedback / Incorrect task completion report.
- **Issue:** The `code` mode, despite explicit instructions to *execute* commands and verify output using tools, instead performed a TDD analysis of the code. It failed to follow the core execution requirement of the task.
- **Action:** SPARC must re-delegate the task *again*, with maximum emphasis on the *execution* aspect using `execute_command` and `read_file`, and explicitly stating *not* to perform code analysis. The instructions need to be unambiguous about the required actions.
### [~04:48 PM] Feedback on Task Execution (Pipeline Test)
- **Source:** User feedback.
- **Issue:** The `code` mode reported successful completion of the pipeline test task but did not actually use any tools (`execute_command`, `read_file`) to generate the test EPUB, run the pipeline, or verify the output. It hallucinated the successful execution.
- **Action:** SPARC must re-delegate the task with explicit instructions to use the necessary tools (`execute_command`, `read_file`) and verify the results based on actual tool output, not assumptions. Emphasize the need for evidence-based reporting.
