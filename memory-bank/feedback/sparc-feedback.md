# SPARC Orchestrator Feedback Log

## Session: 2025-04-10

### [~12:07 PM] Feedback on Delegation (Clean MD Task)
- **Source:** User denial of `new_task` for `code` mode.
- **Issue:** Initial delegation lacked instruction for detailed completion summary.
- **Action:** Added requirement for `code` mode to provide a detailed overview of changes/problems in its `attempt_completion` result. Incorporated into subsequent delegation attempts.

### [~12:35 PM] Feedback on Task Approach (Manual Cleaning)
- **Source:** User termination message.
- **Issue:** Manual cleaning of markdown files using agent tools identified as inefficient (time/cost) for the project's scale.
- **Action:** Pivoted task objective from manual cleaning to designing an automated RAG ingestion pipeline. Updated Memory Bank and workflow state.

### [~12:37 PM] Feedback on Specification Delegation (Pipeline Spec v1)
- **Source:** User denial of `new_task` for `spec-pseudocode` mode.
- **Issue:** Initial pipeline specification request didn't emphasize leveraging existing libraries.
- **Action:** Updated delegation instructions to require research and incorporation of public Python EPUB processing libraries.

### [~12:39 PM] Feedback on Specification Delegation (Pipeline Spec v2)
- **Source:** User denial of `new_task` for `spec-pseudocode` mode.
- **Issue:** Pipeline specification request lacked instruction to document the *limitations* of chosen libraries.
- **Action:** Updated delegation instructions to include documenting library limitations for future custom development needs.

### [~12:40 PM] Feedback on Memory Bank Organization
- **Source:** User feedback.
- **Issue:** SPARC mode incorrectly mixed feedback logs and workflow state within `memory-bank/mode-specific/sparc.md`, leading to disorganization. Feedback belongs in `memory-bank/feedback/sparc-feedback.md`.
- **Action:** Reverted incorrect changes to `mode-specific/sparc.md`. Created this feedback file (`memory-bank/feedback/sparc-feedback.md`) to store feedback correctly. Will proceed to fix the structure of `mode-specific/sparc.md`.

### [~12:48 PM] Feedback on Delegation Process (Meta-Level)
- **Source:** User denial of `new_task` for `spec-pseudocode` mode.
- **Issue:** SPARC was not instructing delegated modes (e.g., `spec-pseudocode`) to record their *own* feedback and learnings in their respective feedback files (e.g., `memory-bank/feedback/[mode-slug]-feedback.md`). This violates the core self-improvement philosophy.
- **Action:** SPARC must modify its delegation process. All `new_task` messages should include an explicit instruction for the target mode to maintain its feedback log, recording challenges, learnings, and user interactions related to its task. This will be incorporated into the next delegation attempt.

### [~12:42 PM] Feedback on Mode Selection & Feedback Recording
- **Source:** User feedback.
- **Issue 1:** SPARC mode (Auto-Coder) might not be the most suitable for the task of analyzing Markdown files for artifacts. A mode with stronger text processing or file system capabilities might be better.
- **Issue 2:** SPARC failed to record the previous feedback regarding the need for sub-tasks in its own feedback log.
- **Action:** SPARC needs to be more diligent in recording feedback. SPARC will reconsider the appropriate mode for the analysis task. Consider using `code` mode or potentially a new mode specialized in file analysis if needed.


### [~12:48 PM] Feedback on Task Execution (Pipeline Test - Attempt 3 - Correction)
- **Source:** User feedback.
- **Correction:** My previous assessment was incorrect. The `tdd` mode *did* perform the requested task of creating tests for the EPUB pipeline and reported the coverage increase. The confusion arose from my misinterpretation of the user's intent.
- **Action:** Acknowledge the successful completion of the testing task by the `tdd` mode. Proceed with the next step based on the successful test results.

### [~06:12 PM] Feedback on Task Execution (Pipeline Test - Attempt 3)
- **Source:** User feedback / Incorrect task completion report from `tdd` mode.
- **Issue:** The `tdd` mode, despite explicit instructions to *execute* a specific test scenario using `execute_command` and `read_file`, instead focused on its primary function of writing unit tests and improving code coverage. It failed to perform the requested execution and verification steps.
- **Action:** SPARC must re-delegate the execution task *again*, potentially still to `tdd` (as it's the closest fit for verification), but with extreme emphasis on *only* performing the requested `execute_command` and `read_file` steps and reporting those specific results. Forbid writing new tests for this specific execution task.

### [~05:22 PM] Feedback on Mode Assignment (Testing Task)
- **Source:** User feedback.
- **Issue:** SPARC incorrectly assigned the task of testing the RAG pipeline (generating test data, executing the pipeline, verifying output) to the `code` mode multiple times. This violates the SPARC principle of assigning tasks to the appropriate specialized mode (`tdd` for testing).
- **Action:** SPARC must delegate testing tasks to the `tdd` mode. Correct the workflow state and re-delegate the pipeline test task to the `tdd` mode.

### [~05:21 PM] Feedback on Task Execution (Pipeline Test - Attempt 2)
- **Source:** User feedback / Incorrect task completion report.
- **Issue:** The `code` mode, despite explicit instructions to *execute* commands and verify output using tools, instead performed a TDD analysis of the code. It failed to follow the core execution requirement of the task.
- **Action:** SPARC must re-delegate the task *again*, with maximum emphasis on the *execution* aspect using `execute_command` and `read_file`, and explicitly stating *not* to perform code analysis. The instructions need to be unambiguous about the required actions.
### [~04:48 PM] Feedback on Task Execution (Pipeline Test)
- **Source:** User feedback.
- **Issue:** The `code` mode reported successful completion of the pipeline test task but did not actually use any tools (`execute_command`, `read_file`) to generate the test EPUB, run the pipeline, or verify the output. It hallucinated the successful execution.
- **Action:** SPARC must re-delegate the task with explicit instructions to use the necessary tools (`execute_command`, `read_file`) and verify the results based on actual tool output, not assumptions. Emphasize the need for evidence-based reporting.
