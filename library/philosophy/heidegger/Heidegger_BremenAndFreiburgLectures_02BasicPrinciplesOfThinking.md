## BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THINKING: FREIBURG LECTURES 1957


### Lecture I


The basic principles of thinking guide and regulate the activity of thinking. They are therefore also named the laws of thought. One accords to them the principle of identity, the principle of contradiction, the principle of the excluded middle. According to common opinion the laws of thought are valid for all thinking, regardless of what is each time thought and independent of how the thinking then proceeds. The laws of thought require no regard for either the content of the objects each time considered or for the form, i.e., the kind of thought process. Empty of content, the laws of thought are mere forms. The constructing of concepts, the rendering of judgments, and the drawing of conclusions all move within these forms of thinking. The empty forms of thought can thus be formally presented. The principle of identity has the formula: A = A. The principle of contradiction states: A ≠ not A. The principle of the excluded middle requires: X is either A or not A.

The formulas for the laws of thought play into each other in a peculiar way. Thus there have also been attempts to derive them from each other. This occurred in various ways. The principle of contradiction, A ≠ not A, was represented as the negative form of the positive principle of identity, A = A. But also the reverse: Insofar as it rests upon a hidden contrariety, the principle of identity counts as the still-undeveloped form of the principle of contradiction. The principle of the excluded middle arises either as the immediate consequence of the first two or it is conceived as their intermediary. However one treats the laws of thought, they are held to be immediately obvious, one often even supposes that they would have to be so. For, viewed correctly, the fundamental principles cannot be proven. Indeed, every proof is already an act of thinking. The proof therefore already stands under the laws of thought. How could it presume to place itself above these in order to first justify their truth? But even if we hold the particular question of the provability or improvability of the laws of thought to be an unfitting one, the difficulty remains that in considering the rules of thought we get tangled up in a contradiction. We fall into an odd situation with the laws of thought. Namely, whenever we try to bring the basic principles of thinking before us they ineluctably become the topic of our thinking—and of its laws. Every time, the laws of thinking already stand behind us, behind our back, so to speak, and guide every step of our reflections concerning them. At first glance, this reference is illuminating. But with a single stroke it appears to undermine every attempt to appropriately consider the laws of thinking.

But this appearance dissipates as soon as we notice what befell the history of Western thinking. Historiologically calculated, the incident lies nearly one and a half centuries ago. The incident announced itself in that, through the efforts of the thinkers Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, and as prepared for by Kant, thinking was brought into another dimension of its possibilities, in certain respects its highest. Thinking knowingly becomes dialectical. The poetic ponderings of Hölderlin and Novalis likewise move about within the purview of this dialectic, and are even more excitedly roused by its unfathomed depths. The theoretical-speculative development of the dialectic into a fully executed and enclosed domain is achieved in that work of Hegel’s titled The Science of Logic.

The incident by which thinking enters the dimension of dialectic is a historical one. Consequently it appears to lie behind us. This appearance persists because we are accustomed to representing history historiologically. In the course of the following lectures our relationship to history will ever again play a role. Thus as a preview of this we note the following.

As long as we represent history historiologically, it appears as occurrences, these however in the sequence of a before and after. We find ourselves in a present through which what occurs flows away. Starting from here, on the basis of this present, the past is calculated. For it, the future is planned. The historiological representation of history as a sequence of occurrences prevents us from experiencing to what extent authentic history is constantly an impending [Gegen-wart] in an essential sense. By present [Gegenwart] here we do not mean what is directly present-at-hand in the momentary now. The impending [Gegen-wart] is what waits toward us [uns entgegenwartet], waits for whether and how we expose ourselves to it or, contrarily, close ourselves off from it. That which waits toward us also comes to us; it is the future [Zu-kunft], rightly thought. It pervades what is impending as an imposition [Zumutung] that approaches the Da-sein of the human, seeming [anmutet] to him in one way or another, so that he would surmise [vermute] the future in its claim. Only in the air of such surmising does questioning thrive, that essential questioning which belongs to the bringing forth of every genuine work in any field whatsoever.

A work is only a work in that it corresponds to the imposition of the future and thereby releases what has-been [das Gewesene] into its concealed essence, delivering it over to this. The great tradition comes to us as future. From the calculation of the past it never becomes what it is: imposition, claim. Just as every great work itself must first awaken and shape that human race that each time brings the world concealed in the work into its own space of freedom, so must the bringing forth of the work, for its part, listen ahead to the tradition addressed to it. What one is accustomed to calling the productive and ingenious character of a work does not stem from a welling up of feelings and inspirations from the unconscious; it is much more the alert obedience to history, an obedience that rests in the pure freedom of being able to hear.

Authentic history is an impending. What impends is the future as the imposition of the inceptual—i.e., of what is already enduring, essencing—as well as its concealed gathering. Impending is also the concernfully approaching claim of what has-been [des Gewesenen]. When one says that, basically, history brings nothing new, then this expression is untrue, provided it means that there would always only be the ever-same monotony. If, however, the statement “there is nothing new under the sun” says this: there is only what is old in the inexhaustible transformational violence of the inceptual, then the sentence hits upon the essence of history. It is the arrival of what has-been. It is this, what is already-essencing, and only this that comes to us. The past, however, recedes from us. For historiological calculation, history is what is past and the present is what is current. Yet the current remains the eternally futureless. We are flooded by historiology and only seldom find an insight into history. Newspaper, radio, television, and the paperback book industries are today the standard and planetary forms alike of the historiological calculation of the past, i.e., of its actualization in current events. It would be blindness if one wanted to do away with these processes, blindness, too, to blindly expedite them instead of considering them in their essence. For these processes belong to our history, in that which comes toward us.

We now also name as historical the incident by which thinking has entered into the dimension of dialectic.

What does this mean, that the dialectic would be a dimension? At first it remains unclear what dialectic is and what the talk of dimension employed here might mean. We are familiar with dimensions in terms of regions of space. Dimension can mean so much as extension: an industrial plant of great dimensions, i.e., size. But we also speak of the three-dimensional space familiar to us. As distinct from a line, a plane is another dimension. But the former is not merely stacked together into the latter; rather, in relation to the linear manifold, the plane takes this manifold up into itself. In so doing, it is another domain for a rule [Maßgabe] in regard to this manifold. The same holds for bodies in relation to the planar manifold. Bodies, planes, and lines each implicate a distinct rule. If we put aside the spatial restriction, then a dimension shows itself as the domain of a rule. Thus rules and domains are not two distinct or separate things, but rather one and the same. The rule each time yields and opens a domain wherein the rule is at home and can be what it is.

When we characterize the dialectic as a dimension of thinking and even have to recognize it as the highest dimension of thinking in the historical course of metaphysics, then this now says: By becoming dialectical, thinking reaches a previously closed-off domain of a rule for the delineation of its own essence. Through dialectics, thinking reaches a domain in which it is able to think itself completely. Thereby thinking first comes to itself. Within the dimension of the dialectic, it becomes evident in a founded manner that and how there belongs to thinking not only the possibility but the necessity of thinking itself, of mirroring itself in itself, of reflecting. In the dimension of dialectic there comes to light entirely for the first time why and in which way thinking is reflection. But this, that thinking thinks itself and as thinking must think itself, does not in any way sever thinking as a representing from its objects; rather with this it first achieves a mediation and adequate unification with these objects. The dialectical process of thinking is thus no mere succession of representations in human consciousness that can be psychologically observed. The dialectical process is the basic movement in the objectivity of all objects as a whole, i.e., in being in the modern sense. The incident whereby our Western-European thinking has achieved the dimension of dialectic prefigured for it since Plato is a world-historical one. It comes to the humans of this age everywhere and in various forms as the present.

But now what significance does the incident mentioned above have for the task that should concern us here: for the consideration of the laws of thinking? In the brief summary just offered, the answer runs: with thinking’s entry into the dimension of dialectic the possibility is opened for the shifting of the laws of thought into the domain of a more fundamental rule. In the horizon of dialectic, the fundamental principles of thinking attain a transformed form. Hegel shows that the laws of thought previously mentioned posit more than and something other than what the common conception immediately finds in their formulations. To be sure, the common conception finds nothing therein. Thus the formula for the law of identity, A = A, is taken by the common understanding as a statement that says nothing. Hegel however shows that this statement, A is A, could not even posit what it posits if it had not already breached the empty sameness of A with itself and set A, at the very least, against itself, against A. The proposition could not even be a proposition, i.e., something invariably compound, if it had not first abandoned what it appears to posit, namely A as completely empty sameness, and thus as a sameness of something with itself that is never capable of further unfolding, i.e. A as identity and indeed abstract identity. Consequently Hegel can say, “In the form of the proposition, therefore, in which identity is expressed, there lies more than simple, abstract identity.”1

But Hegel in his Logic has not only made visible the richer truth of the laws of thought, now brought back to their ground, he has also demonstrated at the same time in an irrefutable manner that our customary thinking, precisely where it proffers itself as correct, does not itself obey the laws of thought at all, but instead constantly contradicts them. This proves to be so, however, only as a consequence of the state of affairs whereby all that is has contradiction at its base, which Hegel asserts often and in multiple ways. Once in the statement “contradiction is the root of all movement and vitality; it is only in so far as something has a contradiction within it that it moves, has an urge and activity.”2 Better known, because catchier and thus often cited, is Hegel’s thought concerning the relationship between life and death. The latter, death, is commonly held to be the annihilation and devastation of life. Death stands in contradiction to life. The contradiction tears life and death apart, the contradiction is the tearing [Zerrissenheit] of the two. Hegel says, however (in the preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit): “But the life of Spirit is not the life that shrinks from death and keeps itself untouched by devastation, but rather the life that endures it and maintains itself in it. It <spirit> wins its truth only when, in utter dismemberment [Zerrissenheit] <i.e., in contradiction> it finds itself.”3 And Hölderlin’s late poem “In lovely blueness blossoms . . .” concludes with the words “Life is death, and death is also a life.”4 Here contradiction is unveiled as what unites and endures. This appears to contradict what Novalis writes in one of his fragments: “to annihilate the principle of contradiction is perhaps the highest task of a higher logic.”5 But the thoughtful poet means to say: The principle of common logic, namely the law of avoiding contradiction, must be annihilated and thus precisely validate contradiction as the basic trait of all that is actual. What Novalis says here is exactly the same as what Hegel thinks: annihilate the principle of contradiction in order to save contradiction as the law of the actuality of the actual.

By this reference to Hegel’s dialectical interpretation of the laws of thought, whereby they say more than their formulas state and whose prescriptions have never been followed by dialectical thinking, an exciting state of affairs comes to the fore, the adequate knowledge of which—the decisive experience of which—has not yet reached the ears of current thinking. Admittedly, we need not wonder about this. When even Hegel himself in that part of his Logic that deals with the laws of thought pronounces them “the most difficult,”6 how are we supposed to find our way without any preparation into that dimension in which the laws of thought and their founding become questionable through dialectic?

To be sure, as soon as the talk is of dialectic someone will bring up dialectical materialism. One takes it for a worldview, passes it off as an ideology. Indeed, by this assessment we sidestep further contemplation instead of acknowledging: The dialectic is today a, perhaps even the, world reality. Hegel’s dialectic is one of those thoughts that—struck up from afar—“direct the world,” equipotent there where dialectical materialism is revered as there where—in only a slightly modified style of the same thinking—it is refuted. Behind this confrontation of worldviews, as one calls it, the struggle for mastery of the earth rages on. Behind this struggle, however, there reigns a conflict in which Western thinking itself is entangled with itself. It begins to unfurl itself into its ultimate triumph, which consists in the fact that this thinking has compelled nature into relinquishing atomic energy.

Is it still irrelevant or even immaterial if we think about . . . thought and attempt a meditation upon its principles? Perhaps in so doing we arrive at thought on its own ground. Perhaps we only come across its trail in that we opportunely still detect the violence of thought, which surpasses every possible quantum of atomic energy and does so infinitely, i.e., in accordance with its essence. For nature would never be able to appear as a standing reserve of energy, as it now is represented, if atomic energy were not challenged forth along with it by thought, i.e., was put in place [ge-stellt] by thought. Atomic energy is the object of a computation and steering performed by a scientific technology that calls itself nuclear physics. That physics reaches this point of positioning nature in this way, however, is a meta-physical incident—if not something else besides.

But if it now were to come to the point that the thinking being [Wesen] is extinguished by atomic energy, where would thinking then remain? What is more powerful, natural energy in its technological-mechanical form or thought? Or do neither of the two, which in this case belong together, have the privilege? Is there still anything at all when all mortal essencing of the human on earth “is” extinguished?

The thought that thinking followed in pursuing nature into atomic energy is already more dominant [waltender] than the power of natural energy, as well as any other thinking of nature, and it has been so from the outset. Such thoughts are not first fabricated by our mortal thinking; rather the latter is constantly only claimed by a thought, either to correspond to it or to renounce it. It is not we, the humans, who come upon these thoughts; the thoughts come to us mortals whose essence is set upon thinking as its ground. But who thinks these thoughts that visit us?—we directly ask, under the assumption that it would be right to ask this question since it immediately imposes itself upon us. Us—who are we who so immediately propose ourselves? How will we even enter into such thoughts, without being experienced in the basic principles of thinking?

“Basic Principles of Thinking”—we begin with an elucidation of the title of the lectures. Through the elucidation a path can open for the following course of thought. The elucidation [Die Erläuterung] seeks the limpid [das Lautere]. We name air, water, limpid insofar as they are not murky and thus transparent. But there is also genuine [lauteres] gold, which remains thoroughly nontransparent. The limpid is the unclouded in the sense that every admixture of what does not belong therein falls away. We are refining [läutern] the title “Basic Principles of Thinking” in order to keep away what does not belong. It happens in that we arrive at those determinations that the title would name as the title of the following lectures. The elucidation of the title thus brings us on the path of a thinking that thinks after thinking. “Basic Principles of Thinking” at first means laws for thinking. The latter stands with all of its judgments, concepts, and conclusions under the laws and is ruled by these. Thinking is the object affected by the basic principles. The genitive in the phrasing of the title “Basic Principles of Thinking” means basic principles for thinking. It is a genitivus obiectivus.

However, at the same time a second thing shows itself. Principles of the sort A = A, A ≠ not A, are the basic forms of thinking, the principles by which it brings itself into a form. The basic principles thereby prove to be the object that is posited by thinking. This itself is now manifest as the subject of the positing of the basic principles. Kant, after the manner of Descartes, had made visible in the Critique of Pure Reason that and how all thinking is essentially an “I think. . . .”7 Everything represented in all thinking, as such, is related back to an “I-think,” more precisely stated, everything represented is suffused with this relation to the I-think. If this very relation back upon the same I that thinks did not thoroughly hold sway in our thinking, then we would never be able to think anything. For all thinking, the I in “I think” must be at one with itself and the same as itself.

Fichte has brought this state of affairs into the form “I = I.” As distinct from the form for the principle of identity A = A, which formally holds for anything representable whatsoever, the principle “I = I” is determined by a content, similar to the statement we could make of every single tree, for example “tree = tree.” But now Fichte shows in his Wissenschaftslehre of 1794 that the statement “the tree is the tree” can by no means be set at equal rank with the statement “I am I.” Naturally not, we will say, for a tree and my “I” are something different by content. However, all statements of this form, tree = tree, point = point, I = I, fall under the formally empty and thus most universal principle A = A. Yet precisely this is inadmissible according to Fichte. Much more, the statement “I am I” is the expression for that deed of the I, i.e., of the subject, by which the principle A = A is first posited. The principle I = I is more encompassing than the formal universal principle A = A—an exciting state of affairs about which we by no means say too much when we proclaim that what this rests upon has not yet been made clear, which invariably means for thinking that it has not been brought into its inceptual questionability.

At first, thinking is not the object for the basic principles, but rather their subject. The genitive in the title “Basic Principles of Thinking” is a genitivus subiectivus. But the basic principles are such also for thinking, they concern it. The genitive in the title is also a genitivus obiectivus. Therefore we carefully say: The title “Basic Principles of Thinking” announces something of a double meaning. Thus it poses for us the following interconnected questions: Can and must we bring the title to a univocity and accordingly interpret it only as either genitivus obiectivus or genitivus subiectivus? Or must we let go of this “either-or” and instead of this let a “both-and” hold sway? The “both-and” is an eagerly sought-out retreat for thinking, especially when it is counting on an unquestioning avoidance of the issue.

The mere “both-and,” however, is only a pretense to ward off further thinking. But where it is a matter of contemplating thinking and its basic principles, the “both-and” cannot be an answer, rather only a lead-in to the question: how do things stand with thinking itself if it is supposed to be the subject of its basic principles as much as their object?

“Basic Principles of Thinking”—even a rough elucidation of this title produces a disquiet that we do not wish again to allay. That this may rouse our pondering, we proceed once more in a modified way down the previous path of thought. We ask: does the principle of identity in the form A = A hold because thinking as the “I think . . .” posits it, or must thinking posit this proposition because A = A is the case? What does “is” mean here? Do the basic principles of thinking stem from thinking? Or does thinking stem from what its basic principles posit? What does “posit” mean here? We say, for example, “supposing the case that” and mean assuming that something holds as such and such. But the positing of basic principles is obviously no mere assumption. The basic principles establish something and indeed do so in advance and for all cases. They are consequently presuppositions. To be sure, but even with this word we proceed very liberally and carelessly, without considering who or what here “posits” and in what way, and where “in advance” the posited is thus posited. As laws of thinking, however, the basic principles of thinking posit what they posit as irrevocably fixed. They form the stronghold, as it were, wherein thinking secures all of its undertakings from the outset. Or are the basic principles of thinking—let us recall what Hegel has said of them—no mighty fortress for thinking? For their part, do the basic principles require a concealment and sheltering? But where are they sheltered? Where do they come from? What is the place of origin for the basic principles of thinking? Anyone who would proclaim today that this question has been unanimously decided would be a swindler. He proffers something as science that is not science, that can never be such, because no science reaches that point where the place of origin for the basic principles of thinking could perhaps be discussed. Let us calmly admit it: the provenance of the basic principles of thinking, the place of the thinking that posits these propositions, the essence of the place named here and of its location, all of this remains veiled in the dark for us. This darkness is perhaps in play for all thinking at all times. Humans cannot set it aside. Rather they must learn to acknowledge the dark as something unavoidable and to keep at bay those prejudices that would destroy the lofty reign of the dark. Thus the dark remains distinct from the pitch-black as the mere and utter absence of light. The dark however is the secret of the light. The dark keeps the light to itself. The latter belongs to the former. Thus the dark has its own limpidity. Hölderlin, who truly knew the old wisdom, says in the third strophe of his poem “Remembrance”:

But extend to me,

full of dark light,

the fragrant cup8



The light is no longer an illuminated clearing, when the light diffuses into a mere brightness, “brighter than a thousand suns.”9 It remains difficult to guard the limpidity of thinking, i.e., to keep at bay the admixture of the brightness that does not belong and to find the brightness that is alone fitting to the dark. Lao Tzu says, “Whoever knows its brightness, cloaks himself in its darkness.”10 We add to this the truth that everyone knows, but few realize: Mortal thinking must let itself down into the dark depths of the well if it is to see the stars by day. It remains more difficult to guard the limpidity of the dark than to procure a brightness that only wants to shine as such. What wants only to shine, does not illuminate. The textbook presentation of the doctrine of the laws of thought nevertheless needs to appear as though the content of these laws and their absolute validity were immediately illuminating for everyone.

Yet even the first elucidation of the title “Basic Principles of Thinking” led us instantly into the dark. Where the basic principles stem from—whether from thinking itself or from that which thinking at base has to consider, or whether even from neither of these two sources instantly offering themselves—this is concealed from us. Beyond this, through Hegel’s dialectical interpretation of thinking, the laws of thought have been demoted from their previously valorized form and role. The entrance of thinking into the dimension of dialectic, however, prohibits us above all from henceforth speaking so easily of thinking “as such” [“dem” Denken]. Thinking “as such,” without further ado, is nowhere to be found. If we represent thinking as a universal human capacity then it becomes an imaginary construction. However, if we call upon the fact that in our age everywhere upon the earth a uniform manner of thinking achieves world-historical dominance, then we must just as decisively hold in view that this uniform thinking is only the form, leveled down and rendered useful, of that historical formation of thought that we name the Western-European, the dispensational singularity of which we scarcely even experience and seldom enough acknowledge.

In an early text published from his manuscript remains, Karl Marx explains that “the entire so-called world history is nothing other than the production of humans by human labor, nothing other than the becoming nature of the human.”11 Many will repudiate this construal of world history and its underlying conception of the essence of the human. But no one can deny that today technology, industry, and economy authoritatively determine all actuality of the actual to be the labor of the self-production of the human. Yet with this assessment we already fall out of that dimension of thinking in which Marx’s expression just cited concerning world history as “the labor of the self-production of the human” moves about. For the word “labor” here does not mean mere activity and performance. The word speaks in the sense of Hegel’s concept of labor, which is thought as the basic trait of the dialectical process, by which the becoming of the actual unfolds and completes its actuality. That Marx, in opposition to Hegel, does not see the essence of actuality in absolute, self-conceiving spirit, but rather in the human producing itself and its means of living, this indeed brings Marx into the most extreme opposition to Hegel, but by this opposition Marx remains within Hegelian metaphysics; for life and the reign of actuality is above all the labor process as dialectic, i.e., as thinking, insofar as what is genuinely productive of every production remains thinking, whether this thinking is taken up and accomplished as something speculative-metaphysical or scientific-technological, or a mishmash and oversimplification of the two. Every pro-duction is in itself already re-flection, is thinking.

If we therefore risk what the title implies, to consider thinking as such, then the talk of thinking as such only has a reliable sense when we experience thinking everywhere and only as that which determines our historical Dasein. As soon as we attempt to fundamentally contemplate this thinking, we find ourselves already introduced to the tensions and relations of our history, which means contemporary world history. Only if we are sufficiently experienced in our thinking, in the essential breadth of it, are we capable of recognizing another thinking as foreign and of listening to it in its productive strangeness as foreign. But the thinking, itself historical, that today determines world history does not stem from today, is older than what is merely past, and wafts to us in its most ancient thoughts from out of a nearness whose trace we do not detect, because we suppose that what concernfully approaches us authentically, i.e., essentially, would be something current.

### Lecture II and Review of Lecture I


No one can demand of us that we should think like the philosophers. But it could be expected of us, from who knows where, that we learn to make distinctions, because differences do flare up and by means of these we return to the simple and enter into it in such a way that the simple, now seen as something astonishing, is never relinquished by us again. We all think in some way or other and yet are all inexperienced with the issue of whether and how the grounding-principles of thinking move or even come to rest.

In the present age, the raging storm of world historical battles for mastery of the earth has at its center the calm of a strife in which Western-European thinking has remained entangled since its beginning. It is the essential strife of thinking with that which calls it to think what it thinks and thus to think how it thinks. The chains by which it would be entangled in this primordial strife are of the sort that Hölderlin once named when he poetically asked, in regard to the relationship between the gods and the mortals:

Who was it who first

Defiled the bonds of love

And turned them into chains?1



Whenever and however we attempt to contemplate thinking, every time a blunt consideration is already revealed to us: there is no thinking as such [das Denken]. Thinking—and the talk can be of this alone—is the hidden and innermost dispute of our history. Thinking is what is historical of this history and thus is historical in itself.

At first the title “Basic Principles of Thinking” proved itself to be equivocal in the sense of a double meaning that the genitive brings with it as genitivus obiectivus and genitivus subiectivus. Now it becomes clear: The genitive in the title is equivocal, and thus ensnaring, in yet another way entirely.

That thinking whose basic principles would concern us appears to be thinking plain and simple, taken absolutely and universally. In truth, however, this thinking is restricted to the historicality of Western-European history, although, as restricted to this, it is at the same time unleashed as the fundamental characteristic of the modern world technology of our planetary age. When we say thinking “as such,” then this can mean thinking as general human activity; however, it can also mean thinking as a singular destiny of Western humanity.

The first equivocality mentioned in the title “Basic Principles of Thinking” was apparently only the grammatical dual meaning of the genitive. The equivocality just mentioned is an ambiguity behind which a world-historical indecisiveness concerning the essence of thinking plays itself out. By no means does this ambiguity merely stand next to that dual meaning. Rather the one equivocality as well as the other both stem from the same source into which we must inquire. Accordingly, the multiply equivocal title of the lectures, assuming we now hear it contemplatively, is a hint into the question of how we keep to thinking, of whether we are inclined to experience it in terms of the basic principles.

Assuming therefore that thinking in itself would not only be historically determining, but dispensationally determined, then must not every meditation upon a thinking that is in itself historical for its part be in a similar predicament, i.e., be historical? But then does this not say that we first would have to acquire a comprehensive and penetrating historiological overview of the history of Western thinking before we could hazard to contemplate thinking? No.

Historiological knowledge does not bring us into the history of the thoughts that guide the world. Historiological knowledge represents what was thought earlier as something past, offers evidence for the past, but still attests to no historicality. Even when the representations concerning the past are historiologically-philologically correct, and thus certain within the limits of science, and even if we employ these correct representations concerning the past toward the goal of a comparison with the contemporary, it never gets to the point that an earlier thought concernfully approaches us by lifting us up and out of these historiological conceptions concerning thinking. Up and out to where?

Historiological knowledge concerning what was previously thought—taken on its own and tallied—does not yet guarantee that we send ourselves with our whole essence into that thinking that, from far off beyond us, is given to us in thought by the oldest thoughts of Western thinking, which themselves thereby come upon us. In the meantime, they come. They remain on the way in their arrival, even when we do not attend to them because we are single-mindedly obsessed with analyzing the current situation so as to be able to plan the next one. The industry of continuous analysis of the situation is one thing, but another is the reserved historical glance into the constellation. This is the present that avows to us that and how the most ancient Western thoughts—quietly reigning as on their earliest day—determine and carry out the essence of modern world technology.

Nietzsche says of those thoughts that “guide the world” that they “come on doves’ feet.”2 Thus it requires a fine ear to perceive the coming and the provenance of world-guiding thinking. The historical ear is fine when it is addressed to the appeal. In order to address it in this way, listening must be free, i.e., open, within the breadth of the dispensation that is avowed to the ear. Before all else, such a listening into the provenance of the thoughts that are thought to us must have set aside that form of representation according to which hearing itself is only understood as the act of a subject that draws its objects or, what holds here just as well, other subjects into its sphere. In this schema of the subject-object relation, or even that of the subject-subject, there also belongs the I-thou relation, so strongly emphasized today. Here the standard conceptions remain stuck in the apprehension of the human as a subject, i.e., in Cartesianism.

As long as one pays homage to this conception of the human as a subject or a person, thinking is closed off against the arriving of the dispensation avowed to us. One can then logically proclaim that every speaking with history, since it is indeed arranged by a subject, would only ever be a self-made monologue. This opinion comes to everyone quite naturally because one is accustomed to conceiving the human as a subject. The liberation from this inadequate conception of the human will not be achieved so long as we resort to procuring arguments that this conception would be false. Liberation from this conception requires something simple, that we abandon it in favor of an experience in which we are already residing. In all brevity, this can be stated so: We only catch sight of that which has already sighted us. So that this relationship between sighting and catching sight can purely hold sway, we must abandon the position of the human as a subject, and thereby the subject-object relation, and have found our way back into a more originary dimension of the human essence. We only catch sight of what has already sighted us, and indeed without our knowledge or effort. We only hear that to which we already belong insofar as we stand in its claim. But precisely within this relationship between sighting and claim, on the one hand, and catching sight and hearing on the other, is housed the danger that we mishear in our hearing, that we lose sight and overlook in our catching sight, and thus fall prey to something arbitrary.

The relationship to what concernfully approaches us as a sighting and a claim, to what comes upon us, to what is impending [Gegen-wart] and thus is authentically destiny and history, this relationship to history remains as simple as today it is difficult for us to even achieve and retain such a relationship. The reason for this difficulty lies not only in the representation of the human as a subject, but also in the representation of history as an object and formation of historiology and of historiological consciousness. Both manners of representation, that of the human as a subject and that of history as historiology, belong together in the same kinship. They are of a modern provenance and reach their most extreme unified development in dialectic. The Middle Ages knew a historiological consciousness in the rigorously construed sense just as little as Antiquity knew the conception of the human as a subject. That one nevertheless without inhibition reads both manners of representation into the Middle Ages and Antiquity, not to mention the corresponding interpretations, has its simple basis in the uninterrupted dominance of historiological and subjective representing. The subject of the historiological conception of history is each time to be found in the most modern self-consciousness of our age.

Faced with the unbroken dominance of subjectivity and historiology it remains a stroke of luck if we perceive throughout the age the soft steps of the world-guiding thoughts, in order to follow them from whither they have come [ihrer Zukunft] back into their place of origin [Herkunft], so that their arrival [Ankunft] would concernfully approach us.

The thinking that now determines world history and is itself more historical than the course of world historiological occurrences, only addresses our contemplation when it delivers us over to its claim. While we say this, a consideration imposes itself that is so immediately illuminating we can no longer keep it aside. We are given the following to consider.

How should a tradition reach us if not through historiology? How is historiology supposed to work securely if not in the methodical form of the historiological-philological sciences? Yet, tradition, i.e., that a claim of what has-been brings itself into the space of freedom and that history thereby speaks to us, such tradition does not rest on the historiological knowledge procured by us, but rather all historiology is each time only a particular kind of technological-practical refinement and presentation of that tradition. All historiology requires history. But history does not necessarily need historiology. Thus there are peoples who know no historiology although they live historically, perhaps even in a deeper sense. Admittedly, we today are still all too accustomed to understand the titles “history” and “historiology” indiscriminately, at one moment objectively, at another epistemologically.

The country that counts among its great thinkers R. Descartes, the founder of the doctrine of the subjectivity of human beings, has no word in its language for history [Geschichte] to distinguish it from historiology [Historie]. No one of any insight will proclaim that this is by chance. There where a language has to say what is essential for it, there is no chance.

Because we continually throw the words “history” and “historiology” heedlessly together, along with the manners of representation and issues pertaining to them, and are incapable of drawing any essential distinction between them, the opinion can take hold that human races and peoples that know no historiology consequently live unhistorically. Of the same style— only the reverse—is the opinion that repudiating or overcoming the predominance of historiology would also eradicate the historicality of a Dasein, would render history and its tradition essenceless. Against this, and in what follows we will attempt to bring about an experience of this, we say anew: Because it itself is historically attuned [ge-stimmt], the thinking which determines [bestimmt] contemporary world history only speaks to our contemplation when it has delivered us over to its claim.

Accordingly, our undertaking—to experience thinking from its basic principles—proves itself a historical risk. This remains far removed from the presumption of pronouncing absolutely valid laws “of” thinking. But now it also becomes all too significant that the title “Basic Principles of Thinking” indicates the historical undertaking of these lectures in a richly undetermined manner. At best, the elucidation of the title has perhaps brought us to the path of the lectures, but it has by no means set us out along it. An elucidation of the mere title, even one of this kind, still cannot at all enter into the issue at stake. The provided elucidation remains perforce a precaution for the proceedings, but is not yet the entry into the matter, i.e., the strife, in which Western thinking is inceptually entangled. It would then have to be that the title “Basic Principles of Thinking” speaks a language entirely its own, a language that takes away from it the role of being merely a title and grants it the linguistic character of an address [An-spruchs].

For all too long now we have spoken of thinking without having brought along a useful clarification of what this means: thinking.

Even if we admit, whether from insight and voluntarily or against our will and with doubts, that our Western thinking not only has a history, but rather itself is a, perhaps the, basic characteristic of contemporary world history, then before proceeding any further, and in order to do just this, we may demand a satisfactory account of what one generally understands by thinking. We would even have to demand this, if we are not to tumble about in a fuzzy use of the word “thinking.” Admittedly, at the same time we must also keep in view that the current, worn-down conception of thinking lives off of the historical tradition. Thus we must prepare ourselves to set out along the path the tradition has cut and which it keeps to, the path leading from the early days of the history of thinking and directed toward our present.

How are we now supposed to find the path to an adequate characterization of that which, according to the tradition, is thinking? Is there a signpost for this path? Indeed. It stands so inconspicuously and freely before us that we easily pass over it, without exactly reading its directive. (With signposts, anyway, it is a peculiar matter. They certainly provide a directive, but remain away from the path. Instead of going along with us, they leave us to our own devices in going along the path.)

Since long ago and still for the modern dialectic up until our day, meditation upon thinking bears the name “logic.” This word “logic” is the signpost. Logic is the name for the knowledge that concerns the λóγος. Logic, however, now counts as the doctrine of thinking. Correspondingly, the basic characteristic of thinking shows itself to us in the λóγος. If a thinking is logical, it keeps to its order. For contemporary thinking, logic has become still more logical, on account of which it has been given the modified name “logistics.” By this name, logic procures its ultimate—which means universal—and planetary form of dominance. In the age of technology, this appears in the form of the machine. The computers that are set to work in business and industry, in the research institutes of science, and in the organizational centers of politics, we surely cannot conceive as devices merely employed for more rapid calculation. The thinking-machine in itself is already much more the consequence of a transposition of thinking into a manner of thought that, as mere calculation, provokes a translation into the machinery of these machines. Thus we overlook what happens here as an alteration of thinking, as long as we do not keep our eyes open to the fact that thinking must become logistical because it is inceptually logical.

To what extent must thinking be logical? Logical means here: in accordance with the λóγος. Thinking must be logical because its essence is determined by the λóγος. The λóγος comes to us in the affairs and words of the Ancient Greeks. What does the Greek word λóγος say? Grammatically explained, as a part of speech, it is the nominalization of the verb λἐγειν. This means to gather, to lay together. In λóγος it is a matter of a gathering as much as of a laying. Nevertheless, it is necessary that we submit the German words doing the translating, “gathering” [sammeln] and “laying” [legen], to the Greek manner of experience so that we can contemplate the words as a translation for λóγος. The Greek word λἐγειν still speaks in the name dialectic; δἰαλἐγεσθαι means to go through something in laying it together. Such a laying that runs through everything is called in our language pondering [Überlegen]; this means to contemplate something and thus to attest to the thought. If one will still not notice, then this reference would like to show anew: According to the pronouncement of our own language, thinking as pondering [Überlegen], expositing [Darlegen], interpreting [Auslegen], attending [Belegen], establishing [Festlegen], inevitably has to do with Legen [laying] and indeed in the sense of λἐγειν and the λóγος. Yet by this reference to the connection between λóγος, laying, and thinking, we still do not yet experience the way in which logic interprets [aus-legt] and thus establishes [fest-legt] λóγος as the basic trait of thinking.

As soon as we inquire about this, the appearance arises that we have lost ourselves in a historiological report about the past efforts of the Ancient Greek thinkers to define thinking by λóγος. Yet the λóγος of Ancient thinking is so little antiquated that it remains present just as much in the ancient as in the most modern appearances of world history. What would theology, sociology, physiology, zoology, mineralogy, be without the λóγος ? The λóγος speaks throughout all the sciences, whether their name includes the word λóγος or not. The λóγος speaks completely in technology, if we understand by this the whole of the sciences through which technology in the narrower sense is founded. And not only in every sort of science, but through all our representing, calculating, willing, and pursuing, in every sensing and aspiring, the λóγος speaks. More pointedly, though for many ears hard to bear, it must nevertheless be averred: We may travel in electric trains or automobiles, fly in airplanes or sit in movie houses and in front of the television, we may use the refrigerator or the vacuum cleaner, but everywhere we reside in the realm of the λóγος, which logic long ago first sought to comprehend. What comes upon us today as the concealed essence of modern technology, and not the individual technological devices, this essence bears the countenance and the stamp of the λóγος. We still lack the eyes to see the essential countenance of the λóγος, to endure its sighting, and to bring to this the fitting countergaze. In relation to the essential provenance of what is named by the word λóγος, a word of Stefan George’s from 1919 that thinks ahead to a later time holds here:

Hearken to what the somber earth says:

You free as bird or fish—

Wherein you hang suspended—that you know not.

Perhaps a later mouth will find:

You sat with us at our table

You lived with us off our fund.

A beautiful and new vision came to you

But time grew old. today there is no man alive

You know not if one will ever come

Who can still see this vision.3



The λóγος is interpreted by logic as the doctrine of thinking. The essence of thinking rests and resonates in the essence of the λóγος. What does logic teach about the λóγος ? The answer would be far too long, were we not to restrict ourselves in the course of these lectures to the determination of the λóγος that has remained directive since Greek Antiquity. It stems from Aristotle, whom one likes to name the father of Western logic, and it follows on the precedent of Plato.

What did Aristotle see in the λóγος when he examined it in a respect that remains standard, in a certain sense, for the subsequent development of logic, but which in its originality cannot be included? What Aristotle saw in the λóγος of logic we take from the adjective that he attached to the λóγος. Aristotle names the λóγος of logic, i.e., the basic trait of thinking: λόγος ἀποφαντικός. This adjective belongs to the verb ἀποφαίνεσθαι, which means to bring something from itself to appear here at the fore. As ἀποφαντικός, the λóγος is the gathering that lays before such that it is able to bring something to the fore. The λóγος brings to the fore that which up until now and each time does not properly appear, though it already lies before us.

Let us take an example. A λóγος of the kind that Aristotle has in view, we invoke when we say, “The path is long.” Let us attend now to this λóγος, “The path is long,” in the inconspicuous form in which we quietly think of it along a hike. This λóγος is ἀποφαντικóς insofar as it brings the long path to the fore for us, gathers it before us, lets it lie before us. And suddenly we note that the elucidation of thinking, i.e., of the λóγος and of λἐγειν as a laying, is really not as bewildering and irrelevant as it might first appear.

Thought in a Greek manner, “laying” means letting something lie before, namely what is already lying before, what is presencing, such that it shows itself thereby as what is lying before. The adjective ἀποφαντικóς, enabling the letting appear of something, namely from itself and to here, is nothing less than the fitting interpretation of what the λóγος of logic accomplishes as a gathering laying: a letting lie before. Thus Aristotle can concisely name this λóγος, i.e., the basic act of thinking, ἀποφαντικóς. This word can hardly be translated; verbosely and less beautifully we would have to say: letting what presences from itself appear here. We translate λóγος ἀποφαντικóς more fittingly and with one word: exposition [Darlegung], whereby with exposing [Dar-legen, lit. laying-there] we hear the Greek sense of λἐγεἰν: letting what appears lie before.

It is enough if we now realize: the λóγος of logic—and therefore thinking—is for the Greeks a letting appear. The Ancient Greeks think with their eyes, i.e., through glances. The λóγος, thinking, is a letting appear of what here has come to appearance from itself, of what is brought into the light from out of the darkness and its sheltering. With this, thinking thus becomes a true thinking, a letting appear that each time in a certain respect discloses and lights up what is concealed. Hereby what is dark is not dissolved in a vain brightness, but rather the dark remains what is concealed and thereby itself first comes to appearance. The light remains invariably a dark light.4

The basic action of the λóγος is the letting appear of what lies before. This λóγος is the basic act of thinking. If we experience thinking in its logical essence in terms of the λóγος, then it is revealed: Thinking dwells inceptually in the essential space of a dark light. This is the location where the gods were present to the Greeks.

In this location, we must retrieve what thinking was for the Greeks, λóγος ἀποφαντικóς: the unconcealing exposition of what presences.

Meanwhile, one was obliged to represent the λóγος of logic, the main characteristic of thinking, as a proposition. The cited λóγος, “The path is long,” can serve as the model of a simple proposition. It falls in the company of propositions like the circle is round, the chalk is white, the house is large, propositions that wander like ghosts through the textbooks of logic and grammar as lifeless models. The statement quietly thought while on a hike, “The path is long,” taken as an example of the usual doctrine of the proposition, falls out of its realm so that we are no longer able to catch sight of its corporeal, living statement-character. Thus we must now elucidate—again in the most concise way—what the word “proposition” [Satz] means, if we use it appropriately as a translation for the λóγος of logic and want to duly understand the talk of grounding-principles [den Grund-Sätzen].

Statement means in our older language setting together, composition—as still in music, the movement [Satz] of a sonata. In light of this determination that understands the statement as a setting together, we observe the cited example of a λóγος: The path is long. Here we obviously and quite easily come across a setting together. We know it from school. The simple statement sets a sentence subject, namely the path, together with its predicate, namely “long.” The path is long. The word for the setting together, for the binding of subject and predicate, we find in the “is,” a word that is thus called the copula. If we hold exclusively to this interpretation of the statement, already delineated at the beginning of logic, we never again find our way back to the original statement-character that is appropriate to the λóγος as the disclosive exposition of what lies before.

The Greek word for statement reads σύνθεσις, θἐσις. Indeed everything depends on thinking θἐσις in a Greek manner, precisely as positing, positioning in the sense of setting up, bringing to a stand, letting stand, namely of that which presences, just as it stands. In the Greek understanding of θἐσις, the sense of letting-lie-before resonates. Thus the word θἐσις positing— for us something entirely bewildering—can in Greek mean so much as situation [Lage]—that which lies before.

If we note that, thought in a Greek manner, positing and proposition say the same as letting lie before, then a view into the genuine statement-character of λóγος opens up for us. According to this, the statement is not originarily the setting together of subject and predicate, but instead, spoken in terms of the example, the letting lie before of the long path that lies before. So the long path—appearing through the ἀπóφανσἰς—is brought together with us, and we think it in the manner of λóγος as ἀπóφανσἰς: The long path is, as such, gathered up to us. The genuine statement—the originary setting together—is this gathering to ourselves of the long path that lies before, the gathering of this bringing together of the path with ourselves. The genuine subject—literally that which already lies before—for said statement is not the path or even the concept of the path, but rather the presencing long path itself. This lies at the basis of the whole statement “The path is long.” The simple statement accordingly lets lie before that which lies at the basis of its positing. That which lies before and at the basis of the statement is its ground. What is proven [be-legt] from this ground is what the simple λóγος exposes [dar-legt]. This proving from a ground is a founding. Thus every statement of this kind would be, rigorously thought, a grounding-principle [Grund-Satz].

The λóγος of logic, the main characteristic of thinking, as a disclosive exposition is a grounding of the ground [Ergründen des Grundes] and thus a founding [Begründen] of the statement. It has long been held self-evident that someone who thinks and brings forth thoughts also founds these thoughts. We think nothing of it, that this should be so. But now it becomes clear: Because thinking as λóγος is the exposition of what lies at the ground, founding belongs to thinking not merely as a necessary accompaniment, but from the very outset. It is then revealed: Every λóγος of logic is, as a statement, a grounding-principle in the broadest sense as elucidated here; it lets lie before what already lies before and lies at the ground and thereby brings this to an appearing.

If now every simple statement as statement—as the disclosive exposition of what lies at ground—is already a statement that each time goes to a ground and thus in the broadest sense is a grounding-principle, then what is the essence of those principles known by the title “laws of thought”? What are these laying at the ground and which ground is it that the grounding-principles, properly so called, expose? Obviously nothing that lies before and lies at the ground like the long path, the high mountain, the wide river, the clear night, the cheerful child, the distant god—not any of these, but rather?

We perceive the answer to the question at which we have now arrived just as soon as we attend to the formal nature of the previously introduced basic principles of thinking. The principle of identity reads: A is A. The statement has the form of a λóγος. What does the statement expose? What does it bring to appearance of all that lies before? Not this or that particular thing? Therefore something general? Therefore any arbitrary indeterminate entity that lies before? By no means. The statement A is A exposes A as A. The statement is so little swept away into an indefinite emptiness that it binds itself in a singular determination. A is A. Toward what is the exposition directed? Toward that which belongs to everything that lies before: [that it is the] same as itself. More precisely spoken: This sameness does not belong to everything that lies before like some general condition. Rather, everything that lies before belongs in a sameness with itself, for otherwise something that lies before could never lie before us of itself.

The sameness with itself of what lies before, identity so understood, does not lie next to what lies before, each time in addition to it. Identity is itself nothing that lies before, but it co-constitutes what lies before as such. What appears to lie at the ground of the basic principle A is A, this ground that the statement exposes, the sameness of something with itself, is nothing that lies before, nothing that lies at ground, and in this sense it is no longer ground. But because it is no longer a ground, we speak in a rigorous and sober sense of an abyss [Ab-grund]. The statements that are called basic principles of thinking in an exceptional sense lead us—when we adequately think them—to the abyss. An abyss, however, can no longer be exposed, when exposition means to bring to appearance what lies before and at the ground as ground. How then can we still think statements that lead thinking to its abyss? Thinking only reaches into its abyss when it sets itself apart from every ground. In such setting apart the kind of setting and kind of statement have already altered. Principle now no longer means θἐσις, rather saltus. The principle becomes a leap. Grounding-principles are leaps that set themselves apart from every ground and leap into the abyss of thinking. In the word “grounding-principle” as now elucidated there necessarily appears something absurd. Grounding-principles, i.e., leaps into the abyss of thinking. Yet the absurdity that surfaces here for a moment is neither invented and artificial, nor is it nonsense. Something else arises: The elucidation of the title “Basic Principles of Thinking” now first achieves its goal. It takes away from the title its role as a mere title.

Basic principles of thinking—this now speaks as a claim upon the leaps of thinking into its abyss. Whether the basic principles of thinking as first named, the cited laws of thought, for their part are already such leaps into the abyss remains open. In any case, Hegel’s interpretation of the laws of thought that was touched upon in the first lecture precludes that they become leaps into the abyss of thinking.

Grounding-leaps of thinking—The title now betrays its precision. Namely, the definite article “the” basic principles is not left off because only a few of the laws of thought are to be treated instead of all of them, but rather because the ostensive title prompts us to risk still-inexperiencable and vast leaps of thinking into its abyss. The basic principles of thinking, commonly so called, could presumably be an impetus for that. (The next lecture, which will be held during the week of the university anniversary on Thursday the 27th of June in the town hall, titled “The Principle of Identity,” takes the principle here mentioned as the occasion for an attempt to at least prepare for a leap of thinking into its abyss.)

Now the talk of a leap into the abyss instantly awakens the impression as if it concerned a particular deep and ghoulish or even destructive plan. Yet the talk of a leap into the abyss intends an affair that entirely alters the sense for us, but without forcing us into a murky fuzziness. What is meant by leap is the transformation of the thinking that determines our age world-historically. If such a transformation can ever occur at all, then it needs for this a leap that departs from the thinking that has become calculation. Now a leap indeed begins with a departure, yet how the leap will leap and to where it will leap is already determined in advance by the leap and solely by it. Whether and how far humans may succeed in such a leap of thinking is not up to them. On the contrary, it behooves us to prepare for the leap. This consists in guiding our thinking to the leap of departure. This is a thoroughly sober affair. The sober counts for us as the dry, if not even the bland. Sober [Nüchtern] comes from nocturnus, nocturnal. The preparation of the grounding-leaps of thinking, i.e., of the leaps of thinking into its abyss, is a matter of a kind of nocturne. According to what has been said, this will be an abyss for thinking only of such a sort that thinking as something transformed finds in this abyss a fitting realm for itself. This abyss, however, is nearer to us mortals than we might like to suppose.

Hölderlin sings in one of the late hymns:

For they are not capable

of everything, the heavenly ones. Namely,

the mortals reach sooner into the abyss . . .5



Let us note it well: it is the mortals who reach sooner into the abyss, therefore they are the ones who dwell in the refuge of death and are thus able to die. An animal cannot die; it comes to an end. This may go along with the fact that the animal cannot think. Thinking lives by an elective affinity with death.

We see ourselves brought before a distinction:

Basic principles of thinking in the sense of those laws of thought concerning which Hegel has shown that no thinking follows them—and—grounding-leaps of thinking in the sense of a leap of thinking into its abyss.

And yet, the abyss of thinking is not equivalent to the abyss that the poet names.

### Lecture III, The Principle of Identity


According to a customary formulation, the principle of identity reads: A = A. The principle holds as the highest law of thought. We will attempt to contemplate this principle for awhile. We hear the principle as an expression about identity. By means of this principle we would like to find out what identity means.

When thinking is addressed by an issue and then goes after this, it can happen that it changes along the way. Thus it is advisable in what follows to attend more to the path and less to the content. To duly linger upon the content would already block the progress of the lecture for us.

What does the formula A = A, which one is obliged to present as the principle of identity, say? The formula names the equivalence of A and A. To an equating there belong at least two. One A is equal to another. Does the principle of identity claim to express such a thing? Apparently not. The identical, Latin idem, is called in Greek τὸ αὐτό. Translated into our German language, τὸ αὐτó means “the same.” When one continually says the same—for instance, the plant is a plant—he speaks in a tautology. For something to be able to be the same, one is enough. Two are not required for this as they are for equivalence.

The formula A = A speaks of equivalence. It does not name A as the same. The customary formulation of the principle of identity thereby conceals precisely what the principle is trying to say: A is A, i.e., every A is the same as itself.

While we circumscribe the identical in this way, there resounds an old word by which Plato makes the identical perceptible, a word that points back to one still older. In the dialogue Sophist 254d, Plato speaks of στἀσἰς and κἶνησἰς, of standstill and transformation. Plato has the stranger say here: Οὐκοῦν αὐτῶν ἕκαστον τοῖν μὲν δυοῖν ἑτερόν ἐστιν, αὐτὸ δ’ ἑαυτῷ ταὐτόν.1 “Now it is indeed the case for you that each of the two is another, but itself the same as itself.” Plato says not merely ε’καστὄν αύτο ταύτóν “each itself the same” but αύτο ἐαυτω ταύτóν, “each itself to itself the same.” The dative signifies: Each something is itself given back to itself, every self is the same— namely for it itself, with it itself. Here the Greek language evinces a preference for explaining the identical by the same word and through a combination of its various permutations, just as our German language does.

Accordingly, the more fitting formulation for the principle of identity, A is A, says not only every A is itself the same, but rather every A is itself with itself the same. For the sameness of the same, each time only one is required, but in the sameness of the one itself, however, a relationship appears: Each one itself is the same with it itself. In sameness there lies this relationship of the with, thus a mediation, a binding, a synthesis, a unification in unity. Thus it comes about that throughout the history of Western thinking identity appears with the character of a unity. This unity, however, is by no means the bland emptiness of a relationless monotony. But for this relationship within the same to finally come to the fore—the relationship reigning in identity, already resounding from early on, decided and cast as a mediation within itself—indeed, for even an accommodation to be found for this shining forth of mediation within identity, Western thinking required more than two thousand years. The philosophy of speculative idealism in Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, as prepared for by Kant, was the first to accommodate the essence of identity as in itself synthetic. This cannot be shown here. Only one thing is to be retained: Since the epoch of speculative idealism, it remains forbidden for thinking to conceive the unity of identity in a merely empty manner as sheer monotony and to disregard the synthesis and mediation reigning in this unity.

Even in the improved formulation, A is A, only an abstract identity comes to the fore. Henceforth this much is clear: The principle of identity tells us nothing about identity. Presumably it does not even claim to tell us such. It is held to be the highest law of thought. As law [Ge-setz]—we hear this word like our word “mountain range” [Gebirg]—as law, the principle of identity gathers all the positing of all the statements [alles Setzen aller Sätze] in an authoritative way. Which way?

We hear the standard when we attend to the tonic pitch [Grundton] of the principle of identity and accordingly emphasize its formulation: No longer merely A is A, but rather A is A. Now what do we hear?

The principle speaks of the “is,” of how every being is, namely, it itself the same with itself. The principle of identity speaks of the being of beings. As a law of thinking, the principle only holds insofar as it is a law of being, this says: For every being as such there belongs identity, the unity with itself.

Heard in its tonic pitch, what the principle of identity expresses is precisely what the entirety of Western-European thought thinks, namely: The unity of identity forms a basic characteristic of the being of beings. Accordingly, all of our comporting to beings of every kind stands under the claim of identity. Were this claim not to speak, then the being could never appear in its being. Consequently, there would also be no science. Were the sameness of its object not guaranteed in advance, science could not be what it is. Research everywhere lays claim to this guarantee. All the same, the leading conception of identity never brings any conceivable use to the sciences. But the claim of the identity of the object has always already spoken in the sciences, both before and during the attempts at producing fruitful conceptions and types of procedures. (From their first step to their last, the sciences must correspond to the claim of the identity of objects, regardless of whether they properly hear this claim or not.)

The claim of identity speaks from the being of beings. According to the teachings of philosophy, identity is a basic characteristic of being. But now in Western thinking at its earliest, where the being of beings properly speaks, namely in Parmenides, το αύτó, the identical, speaks not only in the sense mentioned, but in still another almost excessive sense. One of the fragments reads: τὸ γὰρ αὐτὸ νοεῖν ἐστίν τε καὶ εἶναι.2 “The same, namely, is perceiving (thinking) as well as also being.”

Here what are different, namely thinking and being, are referred to the same. What does this say? Something entirely different from what we know as the basic doctrine of Western thinking, that identity belongs to being. Against this, the cited statement of Parmenides says: Being belongs with thinking in the same. Would being consequently be a characteristic of identity?

Indeed what then does identity mean here? What does the word το αύτó, the same, say in the fragment of Parmenides? Parmenides gives no answer. Here we do not find out how we are to think το αύτó, the same.

Where identity itself speaks, and not merely the principle of identity, its pronouncement stipulates that thinking and being belong together in the same. But now we have unintentionally already given a meaning to το αύτó, the same, in that we interpret this sameness as a belonging-together. By this interpretation, do we not call upon the later definition of identity for help, according to which identity is the unity that unites something with itself?

But the statement of Parmenides speaks of thinking and of being. It speaks of the two that are indeed different, but precisely as the different are nonetheless the same. Here one might suppose that Parmenides already thinks ahead to that doubling of identity first thought in speculative idealism.

It is easy to interpret the sameness of thinking and being as named in the statement of Parmenides in the sense of identity as it is subsequently thought and familiar to us. What could prevent us from this? Nothing less than the statement itself that we read from Parmenides. It says: Being belongs with thinking in the same. Being is defined by an identity as a characteristic of identity. Contrary to this, identity as later thought is conceived as a basic characteristic of being. Therefore from the latter identity we could not claim to interpret the former identity through which even being itself is determined.

The sameness of thinking and being thought by Parmenides comes from further away than the identity conceived in metaphysics and which first stems from being.

The guiding word in the statement of Parmenides, το αύτó, the same, remains dark. We leave it dark. At the same time, however, we take a hint from the statement of Parmenides. Thus the path along which we ponder the essence of identity avoids arbitrariness.

In the meantime, however, we have indeed determined the sameness of thinking and being as the belonging-together of the two. We were too hasty, perhaps compelled. We must reverse this hastiness. We can do this if we do not take the belonging-together just mentioned for either the ultimate or even merely the authoritative interpretation of the sameness of thinking and being.

If we think the belonging-together in a customary manner then, as the emphasis of the word already indicates, the sense of belonging is determined by the together, i.e., by its unity. In such cases belonging means to be assigned to and classified under the gathering of a together, arranged within the unity of a manifold, placed together in the unity of a system, mediated in the uniting middle of a standardizing synthesis. Philosophy represents this belonging-together as nexus and connexio, as the necessary knotting of the one with the other.

This belonging-together, however, can also be thought as belonging-together. This signifies: the together is first defined by the belonging. Nevertheless, it still remains to be inquired here what “belonging” means and how first from this the “together” proper to it is determined. The answer lies closer to us than we imagine, but it does not lie at hand. It is enough for now if by means of this reference we note the possibility of no longer thinking belonging in terms of the unity of a together, but rather of thinking this together from belonging.

Yet does the reference to this possibility not exhaust itself in an empty wordplay, fabricating something that lacks any purchase in a verifiable state of affairs? It appears so until we look more keenly and let the matter speak.

The reference to belonging-together in the sense of belonging-together emerges from the perspective on a state of affairs already mentioned. It is only on account of its simplicity that it is difficult to keep in view. Meanwhile the state of affairs comes readily nearer to us when we observe the following: With the elucidation of belonging-together as belonging-together the discussion brings into view that sameness in which, according to the statement of Parmenides, thinking and being belong. Accordingly, we consider belonging-together from what belongs together there, namely thinking and being.

If we understand thinking as the privilege of the human, then the belonging-together of the human and being stands as our topic. Yet we see ourselves instantly compelled by the question: What does being mean? Who or what is the human? Everyone easily sees that without the adequate answering of these questions we lack the footing upon which we could discern something reliable about the belonging-together of thinking and being. As long as we question in this way, however, we remain trapped in the attempt to arrange and explain the coordination of the human and being as starting either from the human or from being. The footholds of the coordination remain the traditional conceptions of the human and being. We thus think in terms of the unity of a conceivable ordering together, one that is determined by either the human or being, instead of just for once attending to whether and how in this belonging-together, and above all else, a belonging could come into play. We stubbornly fail to hear that this belonging-together has already addressed us. To what extent is this the case?

The possibility of perceiving the claim of the belonging-together of the human and being, even if only from a distance, already arises when we more carefully ponder what is included under the current definitions of the essence of the human and of being.

Obviously the human is a kind of being. As such, he belongs in the whole of being. Belonging still means here classified under being. But as the thinking being [Wesen], the distinction of the human consists in his understanding the being of beings because, as addressed by being, he corresponds to this. The human is this relation of correspondence and he is only this. In the human essence there reigns a belonging to being, a belonging that hearkens to being because it is delivered into the ownership of this.

And being? Let us think being according to its inceptual sense as presencing [An-wesen]. Being does not presence for the human incidentally or as an exception. Rather, being essences and endures only in that it concernfully approaches [an-geht] the human. For it is the human, open for being, who first lets this arrive [ankommen] as presencing. Presencing needs the open of an illuminated clearing and is thereby transferred into the ownership of the human essence. This by no means says that being would be posited first or solely by the human. On the contrary, the following becomes clear:

The human and being are both pervaded by a belonging-to-one-another. From this belonging-together, which has not been considered more closely, the human and being have first received those essential definitions by which they are metaphysically conceptualized in philosophy.

Yet we never experience the prevailing belonging-together of the human and being as long as we reside within the mere representation of classifications and mediations. Such representing only ever shows us a knot that is tied from either being or the human and it thinks the together of the two as defined in this way. Representation does not let us enter into the belonging-together. How has it come to this? How can we experience this more closely? In this way, that we set ourselves apart from the bearing that merely conceives of such ties. This setting oneself apart [Sichabsetzen] is a principle [Satz] in the sense of a leap, one that leaps away, away from the current conception of the human as animal rationale and a subject for objects, away from being as the ground of beings.

Where does this leap of departure leap to, if it leaps away from the ground? Does it leap into an abyss? Yes, insofar as we still conceive the leap within the horizon of metaphysical thinking. No, insofar as we leap and let ourselves loose. To where? To there where we are already admitted: into a belonging to being, but to a being [Sein] that itself belongs to us, in that only with us can it essence, i.e., presence [an-wesen], as being.

Thus, in order to properly experience the belonging-together of the human and of being, a leap is necessary. This leap is the suddenness of a bridgeless entrance into that belonging which alone will allocate the reciprocality of the human and being and thus the constellation of the two. The leap is the sudden entrance into the realm from which being and the human have each time already reached one another in their essence.

A strange leap that presumably brings us the insight that we still do not sufficiently reside there where we authentically already are. Where are we? In which constellation of the human and being? Which belonging-together, which identity, and what kind, pervades the essence of being and the human? Out of what region does the claim of this identity, thought as belonging-together, speak?

Today it at least appears that one no longer requires laborious references, as was the case for years, to catch sight of the constellation in which the human and being belong together. One would like to imagine that it is enough to say the name “atomic age” in order to find out which being [Sein] it is that presences for us today. But are we allowed, then, to posit the technological world as at one with being? Apparently not, not even if we representatively understand this world as the whole of unleashed atomic energy together with the calculative planning and automatization that permeate all areas of human dwelling. Why does the reference to the technological world still not bring the contemporary constellation of the human and being into view? Because it thinks too briefly. For the whole of the technological world just mentioned is conceived in advance as something made by humans. The technological, taken in its broadest sense and in its manifold appearances, counts as the plan that the human projects, a plan that finally urges the human into the decision of whether he is to become a servant of his plan or to remain its master.

With this representation of the whole of the technological world, one winds everything back upon the human and, at best, arrives at the demand for an ethics of the technological world. Caught up in this conception, one opines that technology would be merely the affair of humans, no claim of being would speak in it. Obsessed with this opinion, we still do not even attend just once to the togetherness of the human and being, much less do we attempt to listen for the belonging that first extends both of these, the human and being, to one another.

For ourselves, let us finally set aside conceiving the technological merely technologically, i.e., starting from the human and its machines. In this age, let us attend to the claim under which there stands not only the human, but all beings, nature and history, in respect to their being.

What claim do we mean? Our whole Dasein finds itself everywhere challenged to take up the planning and calculating of everything. What speaks in this challenge? Does it spring from a self-made human whim? Or do not all beings already only concern us insofar as they address us in their planability and calculability? What comes to light here? Nothing less than this: The human is challenged, i.e., positioned, to the same extent that being is. The being of beings is itself challenged, i.e., positioned, to let all beings presence in planability and calculability, first of all the human, so that he secures the beings that concern him as the standing reserve for his planning and calculating, and that he drives this requisitioning interminably. The claim that lets the being appear in planability and calculability and that also challenges the human into requisitioning the beings that thereby appear, this claim constitutes the constellation in which we reside. The whole essence of the modern technological world is determined by this.

The name for the gathering of the challenges that being and the human deliver to each other such that they reciprocally position one another is “positionality” [das Ge-Stell]. One is unjustly jarred by this word. Instead of “placing” [Stellen] we also say “setting” [Setzen] and find nothing wrong in our use of the word “law” [Gesetz]. We understand the word “positionality” as corresponding to the word “law.” Positionality is the collection of standards [Maßgabe] for all setting, placing, and ordering, wherein the human and being concernfully approach one another. Positionality lets the human and being belong to each other in a bewildering manner. It is bewildering because we no longer find what positionality means within the representational horizon that lets us think the being of beings. For at one time, that which is to be thought in the word “positionality” did not lie over against the human. Positionality no longer concernfully approaches us [geht uns . . . an] like being as presencing [An-wesen]. Positionality first determines being in a togetherness with the human. But what is to be thought in the word “positionality” is bewildering above all because it itself is nothing final, but first playfully solicits of us that which genuinely reigns through the contemporary constellation of the human and being.

The belonging-together of the human and being in the manner of a reciprocal challenging forth brings startlingly nearer to us both that and how the human is brought into the ownership of being and being is delivered into the ownership of the human essence. In positionality there reigns a bringing into ownership [Vereignen] and a delivering into ownership [Zueignen]. It is worth simply experiencing this owning [Eignen] wherein the human and being are appropriated [ge-eignet] to each other, i.e., enter into what we name the event of appropriation [Ereignis].

The word “event” [Ereignis] is taken from ordinary language. To appropriate [Er-eignen] means originally to eye [eräugen], i.e., to catch sight of, to call into view, to take possession [an-eignen]. More originarily thought, the word “event” is now, as a guiding word, taken into the service of a thinking that attempts to keep in memory that dark word of Parmenides: το αύτó —the same is thinking and being. The word “event of appropriation” [Ereignis] can be translated just as little as the Greek guiding word λóγος or the Chinese Tao. The word event of appropriation here no longer means that which we otherwise name an occurrence, an incident. The word is now used as a singulare tantum.

Event of appropriation names the letting belong that is to be thought from it, and thus the authentic letting belong that brings the human and being into the ownership of each other. In positionality, what we experience as the essence of this constellation in the modern technological world is a prelude to what is called the event of appropriation. The event of appropriation does not necessarily or even merely remain in its prelude so as to let the human and being belong together in the manner of positionality. Rather, in the event of appropriation, the possibility arises that the event as the sheer reign of positionality is converted [verwindet] into a more inceptual appropriating. One such conversion of positionality from the event of appropriation—something never accomplishable by humans alone—would result in the appropriative retraction of the technological world from its position of mastery into one of servitude within a realm where the human more authentically reaches into the event of appropriation.

It appears as though we fell prey to the danger of all too casually directing our thinking toward some far-off universal, while under the name “event of appropriation” only what is the nearest of the near—that within which we already reside— immediately avows itself to us. But what could be nearer to us than that which brings us near to what we belong to—wherein we are what belongs—that is, the event of appropriation?

The beginning of this lecture issued the directive: attend to the path. Where has the path led? To the entrance of our thinking into what is simple, which we name the event of appropriation in a rigorous sense. It lets the human and being belong in a togetherness. Belonging now means brought into ownership, delivered into ownership. By his essence, because he is needed, the human is brought into the ownership of what is at first still called “being.” As presencing, being is delivered into the ownership of the human essence.

Who we humans authentically are and what being authentically is, we may first duly question and surmise only when thinking has entered that region where appropriation [Eignung], bringing into ownership [Vereignung], propriety [Eigentum], and authenticity [Eigentlichkeit] reign, namely, in the event of appropriation [Er-eignis].

The event of appropriation is the realm, resonating in itself, through which the human and being reach one another in their essence, and achieve their essencing [ihr Wesendes] by losing those definitions that metaphysics has loaned to them.

To think the event of appropriation as event of appropriation means to work at building the structure of this realm. Thinking acquires the tool for building this self-suspending structure from language. For language is the most tender resonance, holding everything in this relation, in the suspended structure of the event of appropriation.

Indeed, what does that which has been said up to now have to do with the principle of identity? We answer by going back along the path traversed.

The event of appropriation brings the human and being into the ownership of their essential togetherness. We catch sight of a first appearance of this event, one compelling for us today, in positionality. But positionality constitutes the essence of the modern technological world. Positionality everywhere immediately approaches us. Positionality is, if we now be so permitted to speak, more extant than all atomic energy and all mechanical engineering, more extant than every form of organization, information, and automation. In positionality we catch sight of a belonging together of the human and being wherein the letting-belong first determines the type of togetherness and its unity. Positionality challenges the human to the calculation of being, itself arrogated into calculability. Positionality poises both the human and being to challenge each other into the requisitioning of beings as orderable standing reserve.

We were brought to the question of a belonging-together where the belonging takes precedence over the togetherness by the statement of Parmenides: “The same, namely, is thinking as well as also being.” The question concerning the sense of this same, i.e., concerning the sameness of what is different, is the question concerning the essence of identity. According to the doctrine of metaphysics, identity holds as a basic characteristic of the being of beings. (The principle of identity says this as well, if we hear its formula A is A in its genuine intonation. Concerning the essence of identity, the principle of identity provides no information.) Contrary to this, the statement of Parmenides wherein identity itself speaks through the το αύτó, contains a hint. Yet the word το αύτó, the same, remains a riddle and remains so as long as thinking is not successful in thinking ahead to that region where belonging-together addresses us as belonging-together. In that region, one would experience the essential provenance of identity. Might we not search for the place of provenance of identity in what our thinking would like to come nearer to under the name “event of appropriation”?

The essence of identity is the propriety of the appropriative event [Eigentum des Er-eignisses]. We can only sensibly speak of authenticity when we think it in terms of the event of appropriation. If there could be something tenable in the attempt to point our thinking into the place of the essential provenance of identity, then what would become of the title of this lecture? The sense of the title “The Principle of Identity” would have changed.

The principle of identity first presents itself as a basic principle that says identity would be a characteristic of being, i.e., at the basis of beings. Along the way, this statement, in the sense of an expression, has become a principle in the manner of a leap that sets itself apart from being understood as the ground of beings and thus leaps into the abyss. Indeed this abyss is neither the empty nothing nor an obscure confusion, but rather the event of appropriation. In the event of appropriation, the essence of language resonates as that which speaks, that essence that once was named the house of being.3

Principle of identity now says: a leap that achieves the event of appropriation, i.e., the essence of identity, because the event needs it if the belonging-together of the human and being are otherwise to achieve the essential light of the event of appropriation.

On the way from principle as an expression about identity to the principle as a leap into the essential provenance of a belonging-together, thinking has transformed itself. Thus the thoughtful glance looks past the situation of humans in the present and catches sight of the constellation of being and the human from what first appropriates each to the other, from the event of appropriation.

Assuming the possibility would remain waiting for us that positionality, i.e., the challenging forth of the human and being into the calculability of the calculable, would be unveiled as the event of appropriation that first brings the human and being into the ownership of what is authentically their own, then this would clear a path along which the human would more inceptually experience beings, the whole of the modern technological world, nature and history, and, above all, the being of all of this.

As long as the contemporary meditation on the world of atomic energy, in all the seriousness of responsibility, only urges for—and thereby satisfies itself with—pursuing the peaceful use of energy, contemplation remains standing at the halfway point. Consequently, the technological world in its metaphysical predominance is more deeply secured, and first rightly so.

Yet where was it determined that, forever into the future, nature would remain the nature of modern physics and history only present itself as an object of historiology? Indeed, we can neither discard the contemporary technological world as the devil’s work, nor are we permitted to annihilate it, assuming it does not take care of this itself. Still less are we permitted to indulge in the opinion that the modern technological world would be the sort that just prohibits a leap of departure. This opinion emerges from the obsession with current events, which it holds to be the solely actual. This opinion is nevertheless fantastical, but not however the contemplation that looks toward what comes upon us as the claim of the essence of the identity of the human and being.

Whatever and however we attempt to think, we think in the play-space of a tradition. It reigns when, from out of our retrospective thinking, it releases us for a thinking ahead that is no longer a planning. Indeed only when we turn ourselves toward [zuwenden] what has already been thought will we be brought around to [verwendet; used for] what is yet to be thought.

### Lecture IV


The following meditation passes over the last lecture, which discussed the principle of identity. Rather, this meditation recalls the course of the second lecture, admittedly now after the third, in order to traverse it once again toward other prospects. But because the lecture concerning the principle of identity is established in a particular manner as written and also as spoken,1 a short afterword is required.

Long ago, thus in advance, it was already written. We find it in one of the dialogues of Plato that bears the name Phaedrus. Toward the end of this conversation, Socrates brings the discussion to the εὐπρέπεια καὶ ἀπρέπεια τῆς γραφῆς,2 to what is seemly and unseemly of writing and the written. Socrates then recounts a story from Ancient Egypt.3

SOCRATES: Thus: I heard that in the region of Naucratis in Egypt, one of the old gods of the country is domiciled, to whom also belongs the sacred bird that they name the Ibis—the name of the god himself is Theuth. He is the first inventor of number and calculation, of geometry and astronomy, and further of the board and dice games, and above all of writing. At that time the king of the whole of Egypt was Thamus—he ruled in the great city of the upper region that the Greeks call the Egyptian Thebes, and the god: Ammon. Theuth came to him and showed him his arts and explained that it was necessary to allow all Egyptians to take part in them. Thamus, however, asked about the use of each art and, as Theuth gave his explanations, Thamus meted out praise or censure according to whether a description pleased or displeased him. Thamus is supposed to have expressed much to Theuth in both directions about each of the arts—it would be too laborious to repeat it all. But when he came to writing: “This, O King,” Theuth said then, “this knowledge will make the Egyptians wiser and strengthen their memory; for it was invented as an aid to memory and wisdom.” But he objected: “Oh you masterful technician, Theuth! To one goes the capacity to invent skills in technical arts, but indeed to another that of passing judgment as to what harm or benefit they bring to those who are supposed to use them. Even you as father of writing have now, out of affection, proclaimed the opposite of what it is capable. For it will produce forgetfulness in the soul of those who learn it through neglect of the memory—from trust in writing they will recollect externally, through foreign figures, not internally from what is their own. Thus you have invented an aid not for memory but for recollecting. Of wisdom, however, you administer to the pupils only the appearance, not the truth; for knowing much without instruction, they will appear to be full of insight, while for the most part they are without insight and difficult in dealings—having become someone apparently wise, instead of someone wise.”

PHAEDRUS: Oh, Socrates—whether from Egypt or wherever else you like, how effortlessly you produce stories!



In the course of reflecting on this story, Socrates says to Phaedrus (275c5–d6).

SOCRATES: Whoever now is of the opinion that he could leave his art 〈namely that of speech〉 behind in something written, and also he who takes it 〈what is written〉 up again as though something clear and reliable would come forth from what has been written, each of them is totally naive and has in truth no knowledge of the pronouncement of the god Ammon, if he believes that written speech would be useful for something other than facilitating the one who knows 〈namely, the one who already knows what the writing wants to say〉 in again coming across what is written.



Phaedrus remarks of the words quoted by Socrates only: ‘Οῥθóτατα; “Quite right.” Socrates continues:

SOCRATES: There is somehow something uncanny, my Phaedrus, in writing and in what is written itself and in this it is truly like painting. For in this, too, its figures stand there as though alive, but if you ask them anything, they are augustly and wholly silent. Written speeches, however, also do the same. You might be of the opinion that they said something about what they consider, so to speak, but when you ask with the intention of finding out something of what they say: ἕν τι σημαίνει μόνον ταὐτὸν ἀεί—a certain one repeatedly announces only one and the same thing 〈it sticks to an indeterminate monotony〉. Once written down, however, every speech roams about everywhere, just as much with those to whose ears they belong as with those that they do not concern. The written speech on its own admittedly does not know to whom it should speak and to whom it should not. And if the speech is mishandled or even mischievously berated, then it always needs its father as its helper. For it is neither able to defend nor help itself.



Through the conversation between Socrates and his young friend Phaedrus, Plato himself speaks. He, the poetic master of the thoughtful word, indeed speaks here only of writing, but indicates at the same time what always came over him ever anew throughout his whole path of thought, namely that what is thought in thinking cannot be expressed. Indeed, it would be too hasty to conclude that therefore what is thought would be unspeakable. Rather, Plato knew that it would be the task of thinking to bring the unsaid near to thinking by means of a saying, and to bring it near precisely as the issue that is to be thought. Thus even in what is written by him, what Plato thought is never there to be read directly, even though there are written conversations, but because we too greedily and erroneously search for a doctrine we are only rarely able to release these conversations into the pure movement of a concentrated thinking.

It is now necessary to link this meditation to the second lecture. At its beginning was said: “In some way we all think and nevertheless are all inexperienced with the issue of whether and how grounding-principles move thinking or even bring it to rest.” This remark understood the word “grounding-principles” already in the transformed sense of leaps into the abyss; “move thinking”—this means to build a path for thinking; “bring to a rest”—this means to bring to where all movement is first gathered, not in order to end, but rather to begin from the source. Indeed we are—all of us—inexperienced in what is demanded of thinking, if it should otherwise find a way out of its ensnarement in calculation and dialectic. Both of these, calculative and dialectical thinking, are at ground the same, namely in terms of that ground that the principle of reason [Satz vom Grund] names, without however thinking its essence. Yet enough is already gained if our focus turns to the inexperience just mentioned. The path of these lectures may bring us to this.

The second lecture named the signpost. Upon it was to be read “logic.” The doctrine of thinking is called such. If we read the signpost carefully enough it leads us far from all that we would expect. At first we followed the signpost without attending more closely to what was characteristic of the indicated path. To be sure, it must have been obvious that we lost ourselves, or so it seemed, in refining the significance of the equivocality in the title “Basic Principles of Thinking.” In fact, refining the significance of the title is the sole task. Admittedly, we must obviate the misunderstanding that believes it would just be a matter of showing the ways in which the different meanings of the words composing the title could be understood. Behind the equivocality of the title “Basic Principles of Thinking” is concealed a back-and-forth of questioning that concerns thinking insofar as this, thinking, pervades our essence, i.e., the relation of being in itself to us. Experienced in this way, thinking means letting be, namely letting the being be in its being. So experienced, thinking also first gives a playspace to poetizing. So experienced, thinking requires for itself a way of its own [eine eigene Weise], more in the sense of a melody, the performers of which are called thinkers.

The questions that are hidden in the title “Basic Principles of Thinking” require an answer that says how we hold ourselves in thinking, in what way we let ourselves into thinking and engage with thinking, what paths leading there already stand open, what paths into the releasement of thinking are first to be hewn, what paths must then be built. Such questions grow from the supposition that, at a time that we cannot know, a still-higher determination in the essential destiny of being is reserved for thinking. How much contemporary efforts can do for this, or better can leave off from doing, no one knows. Many, even most, indications are that the devastation of Dasein into an always merely calculative thinking will continue to increase. To imagine that nihilism would be overcome is probably the fundamental error of the present age. Nietzsche’s saying, written a few years before his mental collapse in Turin, remains true. It reads: “Nihilism stands at the door; where does this most uncanny of all guests come from?”4 Even today one still evades the question of the essential place of origin of this guest and thereby first opens the doors for this guest to both the East and the West in equal measure; for both worlds are incapable of addressing one another from the dimension that each would first have to be released into, so as to experience both what is and from which essence of being it is that all beings speak.

The attempt at a clarification of the equivocality in the title “Basic Principles of Thinking” gives the impression that this would concern a preliminary and external business. Thought in terms of the issue at stake, however, something else is at play.

The contemplation of the title does not dismantle the given words and concepts into their elements of significance. The lecture discusses the place in which our thinking belongs. In order to recognize this intention clearly and to know it cumulatively [gesammelt], it is advisable now to look back in a unified manner over what was previously gone through, so that the view along the path to the place of thinking might broaden and its obscurity diminish.

Should we risk speaking more pointedly, then it could be said: The sole issue of the lectures is their title. Nothing stands under the title, nothing in the sense of a collection of utterances about a topic. Nothing stands under the title because everything lies therein. The title, therefore, is likewise no title; it is not a heading [Überschrift], but rather a postscript [Nachschrift]. Fraught with all the dubiousness of the written, it writes something out that follows upon our thinking, and this means it would like to come near and nearer to our thinking, in that it attempts to transform what is written back into something heard, and that which is heard, however, into something caught sight of. For only what we have caught sight of do we see, do we preserve as what has been seen (the beautiful). We only know what has been seen, knowing taken in the ancient sense that says: having seen and retaining what was seen, namely as something that continually regards us. What Plato thinks by the word ἰδἐα has its origin in such an experience. For thought in a Greek manner, the “idea” is that outward appearance of things from which they regard us, the humans. But we would still not be thinking all of this in a sufficiently Greek manner were we to interpret the relations of outward appearing and regarding [Aussehen und Ansehen] merely optically in terms of the sense of sight. Outward appearance in the sense of ἰδἐα is no rigid vision, but rather the wafting of χἀῥἰς, of grace. What Hölderlin in an elegy sings of his countrymen hits upon the essence of the Greek relation of humans to the being of beings, as poetized by Plato.

Hölderlin says:

[. . .] and to breathe in this grace,

as is fitting [geschickliche], is granted them by a divine spirit.5

What is the point of this digression? It is not one, but instead just the ever newly necessary thoughtful recollection of what is essencing of being [das Wesende des Seins], the breath of which we no longer detect when we poke around in the defunct concepts of philosophy without thereby noticing that a word like idea and ἰδἐα still speaks if thinking duly hearkens toward it. Admittedly it all too often appears futile today to once again open a view to these simple relationships and thus at the same time to show how they shine through the whole of Western thinking up to the grandiose concluding section of Hegel’s Logic, which bears the heading “The Idea.”

As long as we close our view into the simple shining of being—hindered by what we have merely read about, hardened by theories, hastily satisfied with doctrinal opinions, enchanted by the plethora of daily novelties—for just so long will our thinking go without rootedness in the soil, for just so long will it lack the precondition that would allow for us to come near, even if only approximately, to the realm that the discussion of the basic principles of thinking attempts to point out.

The equivocality of the talk of “Basic Principles of Thinking” is threefold: 1. A double meaning; 2. An ambiguity; 3. A transformation of sense.

If we think through the threefold equivocality at once, we arrive not only at the tradition of the history of thinking, but rather this tradition liberates us for another appropriation of its essence. Thus if what has already been said is at points intentionally repeated, then we may observe: The repetition of the same into what is each time more inceptual belongs to the art of thinking.

Let us consider the first kind of equivocality in the talk of the “Basic Principles of Thinking”: the doubled meaning. Grammatically represented, it concerns the genitive. Accordingly, “Basic Principles of Thinking” means on the one hand: Basic principles for thinking. Taken thus, the basic principles are those laws to which thinking remains subordinated as their object. On the other hand, the genitive speaks as genitivus subiectivus. According to this, the basic principles are the regulations posited by thinking itself. The positing proceeds through the I that, as subject, thinks the object. The double meaning of the genitive indicates: thinking is at the same time the subject and the object for its basic principles considered as rules. Thinking is the object of itself as subject. We must first look past the rigid and truly inadequate grammatical distinctions regarding the genitive for there to appear before our eyes the state of affairs from out of which the phrase “Basic Principles of Thinking” speaks.

What state of affairs? Thinking approaches itself in its basic principles as posited by itself and thereby illuminates itself. Thinking goes and stands in a light that, to all appearances, it itself has ignited. Yet at the same time thinking thereby enters a shadow that, by virtue of the capacities loaned to thinking each time, it can never catch sight of. Even the relation of thinking to itself in regard to its place of origin lies in a shadow for thinking. Thinking pursues this—through every relation back to itself—always from behind, just as though thinking itself cast this shadow. Thinking does cast it and the shadow is thus first cast to thinking. In the nigh tedious double meaning of the genitive “Basic Principles of Thinking” the relations between illumination and shadowing are concealed. They pervade thinking, but they themselves are scarcely considered, they could not be, so long as thinking is designated an activity of the soul, of the spirit, of the subject, of the human, and is thereby cut off from and truncated in regard to its relationship to being wherein it is at home. With respect to this truncation of thinking—something remarked in many respects and nevertheless not relinquished, but instead even held fast to—all dialectic is the attempt to complete it, that is, to define thinking by the whole of its rationally understood essence. But this whole ultimately remains the shadowless light of reason and of the subjectivity that knows itself absolutely. And wherever the shadow is seen, it is only understood as the limit of brightness. But the shadow is something more and other than a limit.

The saying of Leonardo’s: Light reveals, shadow conceals,6 comes closer to the state of affairs. Yet the decisive question must search for the originary unity of disclosure and concealment. To be sure, thinking has been brought into a relationship with light since days of old. One speaks of the natural light of reason. In deference to the definition of illumination and enlightenment, which one accords to reason and to thinking, one has forgotten the shadowing from which thinking stems. This shadowing arises neither from a realm of shades and ghosts, nor is it dispatched with the cheap remark that next to the rational there would also be the irrational; for the irrational always remains the stillborn child of rationalism.

The presiding and ultimately completely overpowering relation of thinking to light, to illumination, and to shining shows itself early on in that a character of thinking was recognized called reflection. This means, on the one hand, a bending back upon the self. Insofar as thinking as representation represents something, thinking appears to itself in a certain manner in what is represented by it and therein finds the occasion to bend itself back upon its representing, to re-flect. Let us note some everyday examples: When we look at the familiar jug or some other thing, the apple on the plate, the pipe on the wicker chair, and thereby only note what is optically given, then this shows that these objects present themselves to us ever only in a particular aspect. The particular aspect depends on the vantage point from which we look upon the objects. This vantage point is a way of our representing. The particular aspect of the object lets us reflect upon our vantage point. It seems as though the object would be an X, around which a collection of aspects can take shape and must take shape in order to completely capture it.

Nevertheless, if we think of the mentioned objects as things, if we experience them commemoratively, then they do not refer us to our vantage points and representations, instead they hint at a world from out of which they are what they are. When, for example, Cézanne lets the montagne St. Victoire appear in his paintings again and again and the mountain presences as the mountain ever more simply and powerfully, then this does not lie solely, nor even primarily, in that Cézanne discovers himself ever more decisively through his painterly technique, but rather in that the “topic” moves, i.e., speaks, ever more simply. The artist is capable of hearing this claim more purely each and every time such that this claim guides the brush for him and even proffers the colors to him. The painter paints what he hears as the appeal of the essence of things. All art, not only poetry, moves in the realm that speaks as language and requires something besides a reflection on objects and the representation of the same. However, to the extent that thinking is now experienced as representation, which poses what presences both before itself and toward itself, there belongs to thinking a return relation to itself, a reflection. As a consequence of the self-unfolding dominance of reflection, the being first becomes an object. On the other hand, and more poignantly, reflection means the shining back upon thinking of what is thought in thinking and, conversely, of thinking upon what is thought. This shining in itself of thinking, intimated in Plato’s interpretation of being as ἰδἐα, first comes completely to the fore for thinking as soon as reflection in the initial sense mentioned above comes fully into play in all possible regards. This occurs where the subjectivity of the subject is thought absolutely, in speculative idealism. The meager distinction between a genitivus subiectivus and obiectivus in the talk of “Basic Principles of Thinking” first comes to life and reveals what it properly names when we think ahead to the reflection-character of representing.

All thinking, in some way, even if as yet undefined, is a thinking of itself and is nevertheless no mere self-mirroring. In accordance with the return relation to itself that is characteristic of it, thinking can revolve around itself, at times in a lofty sense, at times in a superficial one; ultimately, in the grand style, thinking itself can even draw the circle along which it revolves around itself in its orbiting.

Along a long and convoluted path, Western-European thinking finally and wittingly reached the ambit of light formed by it and its reflection-character. This light-dimension is speculative dialectics that, after the precedent of Kant, develops itself into a system in the thinking of Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. The system to be contemplated here would remain misunderstood were we to represent it as merely a woven net of concepts thrown over actuality. As “the thought” [der Gedanke] the system is being itself, dissolving all beings in itself and thus sketching out the preliminary form of what now comes to the fore as the essence of the technological world.

That the world stamped by the metaphysics of Karl Marx can become a—I say “a,” not “the” and not “the authentic”— gathering ground for the whole of the modern technological world is founded on the essence of the issue at stake. For the metaphysics of Karl Marx depends more decisively than one thinks on the speculative idealism of the metaphysics of Hegel, and depends here in the most decisive form of dependence, namely that of mere antagonism. This appears in that the metaphysics of Marxism remains dialectics and must so remain. The dialectic and its system, here and there, are no contrived houses of concepts, but rather life and actuality; they are also this even if in an entirely different way for the pair of poets who are also friends of the speculative thinkers Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel— for Hölderlin and Novalis. In their “night songs,” both have seen that dark light wherein the rational brightness of absolute logic is cancelled, but at the same time presupposed and confirmed.7

The reflection-character of thinking and its development into dialectic belong together. Both of them, as well as their belonging together, are rooted in the fact that Western thinking, already at its dawn, was cast such that founding and calculating in the broadest sense took priority.

Our historical consciousness is quick to present the dialectic of speculative idealism as the product of a rationality positing itself absolutely. One can explain this dialectic as theologically unworthy of belief. One can, following Kierkegaard’s judgment, suspect speculative idealism of a still-higher swindle, but one thing remains: Speculative dialectic thoroughly dominates today’s world reality, whether out in the open or hidden, conceived or caricatured, ossified or renovated. Behind the harmless double meaning of the genitive “Basic Principles of Thinking” lies concealed the power of reflective-dialectical thinking, which, in the meantime, though originally European, has multifariously spread across the entire earth.

With this we are referred to the second form of equivocality in the talk of “Basic Principles of Thinking.” What is meant is the ambiguity in the talk of thinking as such [dem Denken]. Now, with a glance back to what was said, this can be made univocal. “Thinking as such” is nowhere to be found. Every thinking bears its dispensational stamp. “Basic Principles of Thinking” can consequently only mean that thinking into which we were sent long ago. Let us note in passing that the belief in a commonplace thinking, universal only by appearances and supposedly the same throughout all ages, is one of the sources for the rise of nihilism and the tenacity of its imperceptible powers of asserting itself into all regions of the world.

As soon as we get involved with the basic principles of thinking and ponder these, we see ourselves compelled to experience our thinking just once in its essential provenance so as to be properly there where, as thinking beings [denkende Wesen], for a long time we already are. The path into this experience is pointed out to us by the signpost we have mentioned several times. Upon this we read the name “logic,” which indicates that thinking is defined as λóγος. Nevertheless, this reference itself remains suspended in indeterminacy as long as we cannot show why and in what way it comes about that the main characteristic of thinking is found in the λóγος. That this is so need not count as self-evident or natural. It is a fate that determines the world each time in a different way, as much the scholastic world of the Middle Ages as that of modern science and, ultimately, the technological world of today. This fate harbors in itself the question of whether logic ultimately, i.e., justly, directs the regiment concerning thinking or whether thinking still has not been brought under the protection of the λóγος and its yet-to-be-unfolded essence, as is its due.

Restricting ourselves, we here only mention the following: To what extent has thinking, defined by λóγος, anything to do with what one names the “basic principles of thinking”? This connection is obviously only a possible and necessary one in that our thinking is of a fundamental [grundsätzlicher] kind, in the literal sense, which says that the λóγος as such has the character of a grounding-principle. To what extent does it behave this way? In answering this, we must settle for a few references. The verb for the noun λóγος runs λἐγεἰν and means “to read,” in the sense of gathering, laying together. Aristotle sketches the λóγος of logic as the λóγος ἀποφαντικóς, that laying together whose capacity is such that, through what is laid together—the path is long—it lets appear what was already-lying-together-before—the long path as such. This basic form of thinking Aristotle also simply names ἀπóφανσις. The word in its naming power is not to be translated; it means the bringing-to-appearance, here from itself, of what is already lying before. When we translate the word ἀπóφανσις by exposition, we indeed stress the letting lie before, but what is characteristically Greek—the bringing-to-shine—is lost.

If we attend to what was remarked concerning Plato’s ἰδἐα, which defines the presence of what presences, i.e., being, as outward appearing and regarding, then the correct interrelation of ἰδἐα and ἀπóφανσις as being and thinking leaps into view, assuming our sheerly historiological knowledge about philosophy has not become too stupid to still see this startling state of affairs in its simplicity and never again forget its face.

What is most peculiar in what has come to pass in the essential history of Western thinking is that the characteristic of the λóγος of logic that bears everything, the ἀπóφανσις, the disclosive bringing-to-appearance, just as soon disappears and indeed in favor of the other model of the λóγος that is originally native to ἀπóφανσις. Aristotle brings this concisely and succinctly to light when he circumscribes the λóγος as λἐγεἰν τἰ κατἀ τινος.8 Literally translated, this says: to expose something in the direction of something, namely toward that upon-which and about-which the exposition comes when it directs itself toward what is present. This about-which both underlies and lies before the exposition. Spoken in an example: The long path is what lies before, what is presented in the λóγος ἀποφαντικóς “The path is long.” The “long” is not added to the “path,” as the linguistic form of the expression would like to persuade us, but rather is properly laid together with the long path, whereby the path shows itself as what lies before. The path comes to the fore as long.

It appears as though the talk would be of trivial matters; of trivial matters, no, but of simple matters whose weight is scarcely estimable. The ever-newly necessary reference to the distinction between the trivially common and the bewilderingly simple hits upon the plight of our thinking, which prevents it from correctly finding its way into the space of freedom. Today, to a certain degree one is used to the fact that where the most violent machinery and intricate devices produce something useful, these results alone count as discoveries, while, on the contrary, plain insight into a simple state of affairs counts for nothing. This is noteworthy; but what is noteworthy here is a primordial custom of human opining that what is the feat of one’s own doing easily counts more than the gift of a call [An-rufes] or a sighting [An-blickes] . Thus it is only with difficulty that we find the right sense for this quiet incident whereby with this definition of the λóγος of logic, i.e., of thinking, its all-bearing character just as soon withdraws. When the ἀπóφανσις-character vanishes into forget-fulness, i.e., that thinking is a letting appear—something that occurred long ago—then the version of λóγος just mentioned presses into the foreground: the λἐγειν τἰ κατἀ τινος. This is subsequently dissociated from the expositive-character and conceived on its own as relation. Thus we find ourselves transposed into the long-accepted conception of the λóγος of logic: It is the connection of a subject, “the path,” with a predicate, “long.” This conception of the λóγος is even correct; its correctness can be proven everywhere by grammatical inspection.

The states of affairs now mentioned at first look like themes for a historiological pedantry recounting the history of logic. In truth, however, something uncanny occurs with the entirely unobtrusive retreat and disappearance of the ἀπóφανσις-character in λóγος —this is said without exaggeration. What happens? The course becomes clear for the development of thinking as calculating, founding, concluding. The modern technological world likewise rests on this, the essence of which we will never be able to think through so long as we do not engage in a meditation that shows what lies resolved in the casting of thinking as λóγος, in this disappearance of the ἀπóφανσις-character. That the λóγος so stamped becomes the fate of the modern technological world is just one thing. The other, which is prepared in the withdrawal of the ἀπóφανσις-character, approaches us still more essentially. We can first ponder this by following the signpost still more decisively and further back, the signpost that says that thinking would be defined by λóγος ; for we cannot concern ourselves now with the consequences of the withdrawal of the ἀπóφανσις-character. We find ourselves much more called into the question of what this disappearing of the inceptual self-showing essence of λóγος authentically . . . is, and here and now still is.

By this question we proceed along a perhaps somewhat tangential path, in that we discuss the equivocality of the talk of “Basic Principles of Thinking.” In the meantime, the second kind of equivocality, namely the ambiguity of the talk of thinking “as such,” has contracted itself into a univocality.

Thinking “as such”—this is our Western thinking, defined from the λóγος and calibrated to this. On no account does this mean that the world of ancient India, China, and Japan would remain thought-less. Much more, the reference to the λóγος -character of Western thinking contains for us the behest that before touching upon these foreign worlds, should we risk it, we first ask ourselves whether we at all have the ear to hear what is thought there. This question becomes all the more burning as European thinking also threatens to become planetary, in that the contemporary Indians, Chinese, and Japanese in many cases report their experiences to us only in our European way of thinking. Thus from there and from here everything is stirred up in a gigantic mishmash wherein it is no longer discernible whether or not the ancient Indians were English empiricists and Lao Tzu a Kantian. Where and how is there supposed to be an awakening conversation calling each back into its own essence, if on both sides substancelessness has the final word?

The univocality pondered just now in the talk of thinking “as such,” however, first becomes complete when it clarifies to what extent this thinking is not only dependent upon basic principles, but at the same time is itself likewise directed to properly heed these basic principles as such, to meditate [meditieren] on them. Meditare is the same word that stands in our loan word Medizin [medicine]; medear means to attend to something, to healingly care. One of the oldest pronouncements of a Greek thinker, that of Periander, runs: μελἐτα το πἀν.9 Take into care the whole of beings: Consider being!

Thinking holds itself to the basic principles and considers these properly because the simple jointure of the λóγος already has the character of a grounding-principle. This proclamation loses what is bewildering about it only when we think the word “basic-principle” in a Greek manner and that means from the intact essence of the λóγος as λóγος ἀποφαντικóς.

Principle [Satz] is called in Greek θἐσις. We are familiar with the word from the language of speculative idealism whose dialectic can be characterized by thesis, antithesis, synthesis. Here, however, the word “thesis,” proposition, has the sense of spontaneity, the deed, the practical deed [Tathandlung]. We think of Fichte, who said: The I posits the not-I.10 In the Greek word θἐσις something else obtains. Θἐσις means letting lie before: that which lies before. This letting is admittedly no mere passivity, much more a doing and indeed of a more original and higher kind than could ever be thought and performed by the modern concept of thesis, of positing.

In the later history of thinking, the λóγος ἀποφαντικóς will often be defined as a simple proposition, though this is sooner grasped grammatically from predication, namely as the interweaving and tying together of the propositional subject and the propositional predicate. All of this was already prepared for by Plato and Aristotle, something which cannot be treated here, where it is a matter of characterizing the simple proposition as a basic principle, and of doing so from θἐσις understood in a Greek manner. The λóγος ἀποφαντικóς is an exposition that lays together. It is θἐσις as a letting lie before, namely of that which already lies before and thus lies at the ground of the presentation. Here ground means as much as soil [Boden]. We speak of the earth’s soil [Erdboden], of the ocean floor [Meeresboden]. The peasant knows the poor soils within his fields, ground that only produces stunted growth. In the example, what lies before is “the long path,” the basis and ground that the proposition “the path is long” lets lie before and thereby brings to appearance. Ground here means so much as what is each time present. Every simple proposition that lets something present lie before is a grounding-statement [Grund-Satz] in the sense here elucidated.

But how does it stand with those basic principles that are called such in an extraordinary manner, and this precisely because they are not arbitrary, simple statements like the given example: “The path is long” or “The sky is blue”? In which sense could the principle of identity or the principle of reason, still be called basic principles according to what has now been said? In what relation do they stand to ordinary statements? The basic principles, conventionally so designated, seemingly concern every statement as statement and that means that at the same time they concern what an ordinary statement posits: namely what lies at the ground and what lies before. What the principle of identity posits, identity, does not lie before, however, like the path, the mountain, the tree, the creek, etc. Identity is not something present, no ground and soil in this sense. But everything that is present as such, that is, everything that is in presence, is itself the same as itself. Identity belongs in presence as such; we never encounter it as something among other present things. But then can presence, which itself is nothing present, still be called a ground in the way that something present is? Not only can it, it must be so called and has been so called for a long time; for what would something present ever be, were it not grounded in presence? What would all grounds and soils be, if that grounding did not reign in them, which encounters everything that lies before precisely in its lying before, everything that presences in its presencing? If we were once capable of thinking what is named in the word “presence” according to the entire fullness and breadth that blossomed in the Greek experience of the world, then and only then would we be permitted to say instead of presence also: being. Otherwise—i.e. without the heartful, fulfilled, and thoroughly considered commemoration of the destiny of being from the Greek world—the word “being” remains an empty sound, a deaf nut, or the name of a confused representation.

The specially named basic principles pertain to the being of beings. But for a long time now, being has been thought as ground, sometimes more, sometimes less decisively and clearly. It comes to light here that this word “ground” is itself ambiguous, insofar as, on the one hand, in regard to what lies before, it signifies the presencing soil and ground, and on the other hand, what is meant is not something present, but rather presence itself. The basic principles are principles of the being of beings. These basic principles, however, are also called basic principles of thinking and indeed of the thinking that determines itself from the λóγος ἀποφαντικóς. By following the signpost, we reached the univocality of the talk of “Basic Principles of Thinking.” At the same time, however, this univocality transposed us into the midst of the clash of questions that motivate the entirety of Western thinking, precisely because this is defined by the λóγος. These questions run: Do the basic principles of thinking hold because they are principles of being as the ground of beings? Or are they the latter because, as laws of thinking, they first posit what lies before in its lying before, what presences in its presence, and thus first of all establish being? Or are the basic principles of thinking at the same time the basic principles of being? What does “at the same time” then mean here? Are the basic principles of the two in a harmony or a discord? Or does even such questioning directed at the basic principles of thinking not yet reach the center of the issue? What issue? It is the issue of Western thinking, an issue that is in itself conflictual. Conflicted is namely the privilege between thinking and being, conflicted, whether and how the one reigns over the other, or whether they are even of the same rank. Thinking has not yet concerned itself with this possibility. In the case where thinking and being are supposed to be of equal rank—could a settlement ever be satisfactory, especially when it is to be reached by a third party that would either have to reign over or subtend both of these and accordingly remain what is primary before the two? This would be something to ponder, assuming that the conflict between being and thinking for the priority of one over the other has not previously been settled. But even then, if this conflict between thinking and being were to be an essential one, the primordial conflict, as it were, then precisely then would our thinking have to find a path upon which we could first come to experience and recognize this primordial conflict as such.

Indeed, we are already moving along this path. The signpost brought us along it; it showed: logic is the doctrine of thinking because the latter is defined as λóγος. Yet we go further along the indicated path and ask: Why and in what way does it come about that the basic trait of thinking is found in λóγος ?

Thinking lets what is present appear in its presencing, adheres to presencing, to the being of beings, to the ground. And this? At the dawn of Western thinking, namely for Heraclitus, being itself was unveiled as Λóγος. The particulars of this are shown in another place.11

In the thinking of Heraclitus the word Λóγος already speaks simultaneously as the name for being and for thinking. Λóγος is the one and only word for being and for thinking; Λóγος names both in their reciprocal relation and is thus the word for the primordial conflict between the two. If we lend to the word “logic” a sense befitting this insight, then it is no longer the name for a field of academic philosophy. Logic then names the site where the primordial conflict between thinking and being each time flares up. The name “logic” gains a mighty sound. If we hear it in this way, then let us only note that it can be no accident when the highest peak that Western metaphysics climbs, namely Hegel’s Logic, bears this name.

Now we suddenly see that even the directive capacity of the chosen signpost reaches a little further than we first presumed. For at first we only looked for a guiding thread which was supposed to supply the answer to the question, briefly put, as to what was meant by the talk of thinking “as such” [“dem” Denken] in the phrase “Basic Principles of Thinking” [des Denkens]. In the meantime, something else came to light which can be stated thus: Thinking is never only “logical” in that it follows the laws of thought, rather there are these laws as basic principles because thinking is from the outset “logical,” i.e., is ground-positing [Grund-setzend] and so is referred to the ground, i.e., to the Λóγος as the being of beings.

Even if we only broadly examine these connections, we must realize at which place the meditation concerning the basic principles of thinking plays itself out, namely on the field of the Λóγος. This meditation runs through various epochs of the history of Western thinking until it can prepare the play-space determined for it. It is advisable to note this so that we do not take too lightly the transition attempted in the principle of identity from a meditation concerning a basic principle to a discussion of what it posits. Along the path now walked, the transition, assuming it can still be called such, is announced in that we invoke a third kind of equivocality in the talk of “Basic Principles of Thinking.” But already the naming of this third “transformation of sense” would like to say that what are now called principles and ground and thinking are to be experienced differently: principle as leap, ground as abyss, and precisely the abyss of thinking, which itself is also otherwise defined in terms of where it leaps to.

We can experience the leap only in leaping, not through utterances about it. But these are able to prepare for the leap if they speak of what it leaps away from, of that wherein it is accordingly bound, in order to reach the space of freedom.

The field for the leap of departure is provided by the tradition. Indeed already early on and all at once we find in shifting form the traces of a meditation upon the basic principles. Indeed it first gets under way expressly and along a secured course with the beginning of modern philosophy, and even here at first only hesitantly, though pointedly.

Only with Leibniz, it must be said here, does the meditation concerning the basic principles arrive at a fundamental soil [grundsätzlichen Boden] from which can grow the doctrine of the basic principles in Kant and speculative idealism. Instead of a more detailed presentation, which is not possible here, a preparatory remark may be repeated that Leibniz affixed to one of his short treatises, barely encompassing three pages and without title.12 The preparatory remark reads: Cum animadverterem plerosque omnes de principiis meditantes aliorum potius exempla quam rerum naturam sequi, et praejudicia etiam cum id maxime profitentur, non satis evitare, de meo tentandum aliquid altiusque ordiendum putavi. “When I observed that almost all who contemplate principles are sooner to take the conceptions of others as a model rather than to follow the nature of things, and (thereby) do not satisfactorily avoid prejudices—even when they greatly proclaim this—I therefore resolved for myself to attempt something on my own and to take a higher and more fundamental point of departure.”

It concerns the point of departure for the meditare de principiis. Principium, i.e., id quod primum capit—that which grasps and holds fast and thus holds out before itself that which is first, that from which something else arises, in that it rests upon the former and is grounded thereupon. Principles are graspings of first grounds. Precisely these Leibniz wants to contemplate in their nature and thereby climb higher in the order of meditation. This means: Leibniz adheres to the order in which being and thinking, along with the principles that arose here and there, are both related to one another. Leibniz seeks a deeper founding for this order—from out of the essence of being (esse) and thinking, i.e., from out of the true propositions, the veritates.

This says: When Leibniz contemplates the basic principles, he remains in the sequence and order of the possible steps that are sketched in advance by the essence of metaphysics and logic. For him as well as for subsequent thinkers, the meditation upon basic principles remains of a sort that offers them no impetus and no occasion capable of directing them to leap away from the field of the tradition. But where a leap of departure becomes necessary in the contemporary constellation of being and thinking, this in no way repudiates the tradition. It even brings it more freely along its way and thereby more tellingly back into its place of origin. This announces itself to us in that the leap of thinking arrives at a realm that, in regard to the tradition from which it leaps away, is the abyss of thinking. In itself, however, this abyss is that which the earliest beginnings of Western destiny point to, assuming one succeeds in experiencing them more inceptually. In so doing we merely follow the signpost a little further back until it leads to a crossroads.

### Lecture V


The meditation of these lectures traverses a path along which we are attempting to situate the phrase “Basic Principles of Thinking.” The meditation seeks to indicate the location that the basic principles of thinking reach when we hear this phrase in such a way that it says: leaps1 of thinking into the abyss, namely into the abyss of thinking. Much rests on knowing what this means: thinking.2

As the signpost shows, thinking is our thinking, a thinking indebted to the tradition. As to what it is, this has long been defined by the λóγος. To what extent is an essential relation to the abyss appropriate for a thinking so determined? Answer: insofar as thinking has the character of a founding. The answer sounds nonsensical.

Founding, thought in a Greek manner, means λóγὄν δἰδóναἰ, to give the λóγος, the ground, not only to declare it, but to expose it, to provide it and to yield it: to let the ground, that which underlies, the soil, lie before. Accordingly, thinking as founding is univocally related to the ground and not at all to the abyss. Thinking must eschew the latter in the utmost; for the abyss threatens thinking with the collapse of its essence, namely the loss of the possibility for still finding a ground upon which it could ground itself in order to be able to be a founding that would found something.3 Or so one would like to believe.

But it may finally be the time to ask whether thinking can ever attain its λóγος -like essence of founding as long as it everywhere only remains related to grounds. As long as this occurs, thinking indeed takes its essence, founding, as its measure, but is nonetheless incapable of considering this itself along with its stipulations. If thinking is to consider the relation to ground and the ground as such, it cannot again adhere to a ground; more, it cannot claim to be a founding. Thus thinking must properly reach into the abyss in order to be able to release the essential realm for the ground and our relation to it. If we attend to this more carefully, then the statement that thinking as founding would have an essential relation to the abyss loses its nonsensical character.

At the abyss, thinking finds no more ground. It falls into the bottomless, where nothing bears any longer. But must thinking necessarily be borne? Apparently so, since thinking is no self-mastering activity encapsulated in itself nor a self-propelled toy. Thinking remains from the outset referred to what is to be thought; it is called by this.

Indeed, in any case, must not what does the bearing have the character of a bearer, something that metaphysics represents as a substance or a subject?4 Not at all. Something like thinking can be borne in that it is suspended. Admittedly, to determine how thinking is able to be suspended, from where this suspension comes to it, all this requires a proper experience and meditation. Both are so idiosyncratic that they probably only thrive from out of the event of appropriation.

Only so long as what is to be thought concernfully approaches us in the character of a ground is thinking, as per the correspondence necessary to it, a founding. How does it come to pass that, for a long time and in regard to everything, it is a ground that provides the measure for thinking of any kind as well as for its procedure?

The signpost had pointed us to where we could expect the answer to this question. At the dawn of Greek thinking, the explanation for why what lies before lies before, why what presences presences, why the being is, was determined as Λóγος. So says Heraclitus. We simply have to acknowledge this, not as an authoritative proclamation, but indeed as a word that our thinking must ever again thoughtfully remember and examine. What does “examine” mean? For even today it still sounds startling, assuming we shake off what is familiar, when the being of beings is defined as the Λóγος. Yet this determination, being as Λóγος, belongs at the same time in the nearest neighborliness to that experience of being that Parmenides perceives in being when he thinks it as the Ἔν, the simple unifying singular unity.

Through an inapparent harmony, the uniting one-all and the Λóγος as gathering in the sense of the Ἔ Πἀντα each belong in the same. This same is what is first, from where the being as such is each time a being (being [Sein]? presence). Both the Ἔ and the Λóγος still speak, and with a new decisiveness, from out of the unity of dialectical mediation. As this unity, being conditions all beings, grounding them, and as the unconditioned, being is the system of the absolute itself. The “first from whence,” το πῥώτὄν óθεν, is called ἀῥχῆ—as the Λóγος, it is the ground that grounds. Neither Heraclitus nor any of the great thinkers say anything sensational, but instead say what is simple of the inexhaustibly same. Therefore we are first ripe for thinking when we have lost our taste for the sensational.

The being of beings is lit up with the character of the λóγος, i.e., of ground. Thus a principle of the kind like the principle of identity, which says that to the being of every being there would belong: itself the same as itself, such a principle is called in an exceptional sense a grounding-principle.

If now the thinking that is defined by λóγος sees itself as posed before the task of contemplating for its own assurance the basic principles that set the standard for it, then for a thinking understood as a founding this can only happen in such a way that it leads even the basic principles back to a first and ultimate ground. The thinking that is stamped by λóγος, defined as founding, thus cannot even come into the danger of reaching an abyss. Everywhere it sees and finds only grounds upon which and with which it calculates. The gigantic contemporary deployment of calculation in technology, industry, economy, and politics attests to the power of a thinking obsessed with the λóγος of logic in a form almost bordering on insanity. The full vehemence of calculative thinking concentrates itself in the centuries of modernity. At its beginning, particularly with Leibniz, the systematic meditatio de principiis is also inaugurated.

With this remark we establish an incident merely historiologically within the succession of details in science and in thinking. But if we instead think what is historiologically established here in a historical manner, then we would have to say: The systematic meditatio de principiis first casts metaphysics anew and thus opens the historical course of modernity [der Neuzeit].

With this state of affairs, a widespread opinion is obliged to make reference to the fact that the new position and formation of mathematics within scientific research have led above all to the explicit contemplation of rules, laws, methods, and axioms, and to their painstaking construction. One can here bring in the text of Descartes that bears the telling title: Regulae ad directionem ingenii, or Rules for the Direction of the Spirit of Invention.5 In fact, even if the connections are not clear as day, the text is a foundational book of modern technological thinking, which itself is at the same time mathematical thinking. For a long time now, the framing of axioms has belonged to Western mathematics. Yet mathematics contemplates the principles not because it is mathematics, but rather because Greek mathematics in an exceptional sense remains in accord with the λóγος -and ἀῥχῆ-character of thinking. If we attend to this then even the judgment just mentioned about the role of mathematics and its significance for metaphysical thinking is straightened out. We must ask: Why is it that in modernity mathematics is newly developed into an authoritative form of thinking? By no means merely in the fecundity of mathematics as a methodological instrument, also not in that, since long ago and once again, measure, number, and figures become the “key to all creatures.”6 The mathematical finds such a decisive entry into modern metaphysics because within this metaphysics itself something essential has been decided for it: namely, the alteration of the essence of truth into certainty. This alteration determines the truth7 as a self-knowing, i.e., self-grounding, founding of all that is knowable from the unity of an unconditioned8 ground. This alteration of the essence of truth, which we only coarsely indicate by what has been said, is no consequence of the influence of the mathematical way of thinking; rather that essential alteration of truth first opened up the metaphysical play-space for mathematics to thoroughly dominate modern science in a particular direction. What its own axioms and principles are according to their essence, mathematics itself can neither say nor even ask. That today attempts in this direction are nonetheless undertaken within mathematics and mathematical logic and are taken for authoritative, i.e., adequate in principle, throws a light on the genuine historical processes of our age. They effect an increasing blindness in regard to the basic principles of thinking and their essential provenance because they hold the λóγος-character of thinking, and this in its modern mathematicized form, for unconditional and as solely authoritative.

The decisive impetus to a transformation of logic, something that today is in full stride, stems in the same way as the meditatio de principiis from the thinking of Leibniz. As a result of this transformation, logic as mathematical logic and logistics has an essential share in the steering of the modern technological world. Here let us briefly note: The signpost does not only point backwards into the provenance of thinking from out of the λóγος, it also points ahead into the most extreme implementation of calculative thinking and the increasing reification of its dominance.

The signpost bears the name “logic.” It points us along the path that lets be known: Thinking is determined by the λóγος. Pointing further, the signpost shows: Logic unveils itself now as the name for the meditation upon the λóγος, as the site of the primordial conflict between thinking and being. Pointing further still, the signpost, as mentioned, should lead us to a crossroads.

This is a place where the path along which our meditation concerning the essential provenance of thinking is already proceeding, is crossed [durchquert] by another one. To go crosscountry [querfeldein] means to cut through the fields. Another path cuts across our path hitherto. We would have already noticed that something of this sort could befall our path, had we followed attentively enough the first characterization of the course of the discussion.

At first it was stated that the task was to clarify the equivocality of the phrase “Basic Principles of Thinking.” Three kinds of equivocality were enumerated: 1. The double meaning of the genitive; 2. The ambiguity of the talk of “the” thinking; 3. An alteration of sense.

One easily sees: What is named in the third place, strictly thought, is no longer even a kind of equivocality, but rather something completely different, which pertains to the phrase “Basic Principles of Thinking” as a whole and, so to speak, cuts across the previously mentioned double meaning and ambiguity. For according to the alteration of sense, “principle” no longer means a setting together in the sense of the λóγος ἀποφαντἰκóς, but rather “leap.” “Ground” is understood, thoroughly askew [verquer] but necessarily, as “abyss,” because the essence of the ground itself can no longer be a ground, but rather must be such that the determination “ground” is kept at bay. Grounding-principles now mean leaps into the abyss, and indeed leaps of thinking precisely into the abyss of thinking. Thinking leaps away from ground, i.e., from the character of founding as what was hitherto the sole standard, away from ground as being, which for all founding-calculating representation of beings remains what is to be thought and likewise what is always already thought. Thinking leaps away from thinking and being, away from the λóγος -based definition that occasions the primordial conflict between the two, which Heraclitus already names by the single word Λóγος, a Λóγος which, as the Ἔν Πἀντα, is also called Ἔῥἰς: conflict. Through this leap of departure, thinking does not leave the primordial conflict behind it unresolved, rather it takes it along with it, so to speak, in order to inceptually [an-fänglich] experience the plainness of the belonging together of thinking and being. Accordingly, thinking looks out to whether and how in the leap it would open the realm wherein sameness itself essences.

Thus by its leaping into the abyss, thinking relinquishes its λóγος -character in a certain way and nonetheless does not forget that from the outset it would be determined by the Λóγος. For it was indeed said that the signpost that would point from the λóγος into the place of origin would point still further back, beyond the primordial conflict, to a crossroads. Here the course along the path hitherto comes to a standstill and thereby the Λóγος is first wholly brought into view, i.e., in terms of the whole of its essential place of origin, if otherwise the course must keep to the crossroads.

And, in fact, it does come to such a standstill. What lies, so to speak, askew [quer]? This, that λóγος originarily9 is neither the word for thinking nor even the word for being. Instead, early on with the Greeks, λóγος is the word for talk and λἐγειν the word for talking. In view of this λóγος that here cuts across our path, we ask: What does talking mean, what do the Greeks see as the basic trait of talk in that they understand talking as λἐγειν ? For from early on and just as indisputably, λἐγειν means so much as gathering, bringing together, and letting what is brought in lie before, bringing-before. Philology stubbornly proclaims: λóγος “authentically” means talk. This proclamation is correct to the same degree that it remains a half-measure. For us, talk and talking customarily belong in the horizon of what is known as speech and speaking. With this assignment of talk to speech, we act as though we knew what speech meant and in what its essence lies. But we are far removed from this knowledge. For this reason we use the word “speech” with all reservations. For it could be that talk and talking and the corresponding λóγος and λἐγειν can never be defined by speaking and by speech. This is also, in fact, the case. Already our own speech, whose treasures we scarcely know any longer, clearly attests that talk does not genuinely mean that which we conceive as speech. Still in Middle High German and even earlier, talk rightly meant univocally that which we also still mean when we say: to give someone a talking to, to demand an account, i.e., information, about something, that this person should bring forth what lies before.

Talk and talking do not mean speaking and speech in the sense of an uttering of expressions; talk means precisely that which from early on λἐγειν, λóγος means: bringing before, bringing collectively to appearance. The most beautiful testament for this sense of talk and λóγος is at the same time the oldest, which the tradition keeps ready for us. It10 is found in Homer’s Odyssey, first book, verse 56. In all of Homer’s work, the word λóγος only appears in this place and indeed in the plural with two adjectives in the turn of phrase: μαλακοἶ καἰ αἶμύλἰοἰ λóγοἰ, “mild and charming speech.”11 Αἰμύλἰος means charming, captivating, enchanting. The λóγος can have this trait only insofar as it lets something appear which it gathers to itself, draws to itself. To draw is to pull out. He pulls out, suddenly draws, the sword. This sudden drawing [Ziehende] to itself is a pulling out [Entzückende], a carrying away [Entrückende], and therefore something charming [Berückende]. Only insofar as the λóγος by its essence lets something shine forth and appear, and in this sense playfully solicits and conjures, can it also occasionally enchant and bewitch, which is nothing other than an exceptional way of gathering, that is, of λἐγειν. Thus λóγος and λἐγειν authentically, and from early on, do not mean talk and talking in the sense of speaking—but rather? In our language we have only one fitting word for this and it is “saying” [sagen]. A basic characteristic of saying is the gathering letting appear. Every speaking and talking and writing is a way of saying, but saying is not necessarily a speaking in the sense of a utilization of speech organs.

Μαλακóς and αἶμύλἰος, “mild and charming,” are not traits of the λóγοἰ as talking in the sense of speaking; they do not pertain to something vocalized, rather they pertain to the λóγος as saying, one that lets appear and only thereby can charm and captivate.12

What do we experience at the crossroads through this insight into the earliest attestation of λóγος ? This: The λóγος reigns as saying in the sense of a letting appear and bringing forth.

Saying is a bringing as a bringing-to, which at the same time brings us away from here and brings us into what is said. The gentle power [Gewalt] of a bringing pervades saying. From here on we first recognize to what extent λóγος could become the determining character of thinking.

Thinking is13 νοεîν, perceiving [vernehmen]: putting forth and taking up [vorund aufnehmen], i.e., gathering, bringing to the fore that which presences in its presencing. Because λóγος is in essence a saying (bringing), it could also be cast in that basic form of thinking that we know as the utterance, the proposition, and that we recognize in logic as the sole standard. Indeed, the utterance in the sense of ἀπóφανσις is only one way of saying, namely one that brings what is present to appearance and establishes it in appearance in this or that outward appearance.

Every utterance is a saying. But not every saying is necessarily an utterance in the sense of a logical proposition. Therefore the λóγος as utterance can never be taken as the guiding thread for a meditation that pursues the essence of saying. Saying, however, as the bringing just characterized, is also never merely the belated linguistic expression of thinking, but rather thinking is from the outset a saying, presumably the inceptual saying, pervading all ways of saying. Here we encounter the decisive hint for the attempt to speak of language and its essence. If the talk is of language, we now mean its essence as determined by saying, by the inceptually experienced λóγος.

Thinking as saying is related to the presencing of what presences, to being. As previously mentioned, the house of being is language, this now thought from its essence that conceals itself in saying.14 Being and thinking, the primordial conflict of the two, is native to language, whose essence resounds in Λóγος and is to be considered in respect to saying.

It belongs to the secrets of the dispensation under which the thinking of the Greeks stood, that so early on the essence of language resounded as λóγος and that this resounding nevertheless was not perceived as such and properly considered, but rather just as soon faded away. Instead of this, the Greek observation of language struck out in a direction that, with manifold variations, has remained the standard until today for all scientific research into language and philosophical interpretation of the essence of language. It is the conception of language defined from φωνῆ, from vocalization, and from the γλώσσα, the tongue, lingua, the phonetic-linguistic representation. The metalinguistic treatment of language that is now coming to predominance in the AngloSaxon countries, the production of “metalanguages,” is surely not the liberation from linguistics, but rather its perfect reification, just as metaphysics is the perfection of physics.

The essence of language, according to the conventional conception, is neither thought from the inceptually experienced λóγος nor is the essence of the λóγος itself brought into the space of freedom, much rather the λóγος is forced into the narrowed perspective of “logic,” which for its part lends its stamp to grammar as the doctrine of language in the sense of linguistics.

And now we read the signpost completely for the first time, yet differently once again. Logic is not only the doctrine of thinking. Logic is not only the site for the primordial conflict between thinking and being. Logic is—now thought from λóγος as saying and this experienced as the essential resonance of language—logic is the soliloquy [Selbstgespräch] of language with its essence.15

The abyss into which thinking leaps is the essence of language. This essence conceals itself in the essence of saying. Through its leaping, thinking alters itself, insofar as it more inceptually enters into its essence as saying. At the same time as this, the talk of “essence” receives a correspondingly transformed sense.

Now it does not require a copious amount of evidence to see that with every attempt to leap into the essence of language we instantly find ourselves pressured on all sides by conceptions, perspectives, and questions that remain standard for all previous treatments of language and have become established customs. These were already mentioned. They cannot be further surveyed or fruitfully arranged unless, with a little violence, one were to lead them back to a few guiding horizons, a business that does not belong in the course of this lecture.

In the meantime, because every leap remains a leap of departure from the tradition, and this itself is at the same time invariably richer in hidden gifts than a mere quest for novelty would like to believe, we cannot so easily turn ourselves away from the customary conceptions of language. We ourselves cannot do this, even if these conceptions occasionally so mislead our meditation into the essence of language that we only later see through this.

Where something is so beset in the way the essence of language is, the preparation of the leap is indeed necessarily elaborate, even more elaborate, assuming this comparison is allowed, than the most beautiful dialogues of Plato, which, as one can establish, in their to-and-fro and back-and-forth of saying and questioning are precisely without results for the one who goes hunting for utterances and a doctrine instead of hearing what is unsaid in the saying of the conversation. The uninitiated believe that the unsaid is only the remainder that remains lying behind what is said. Indeed the unsaid has its place only in what is said and only through the highest force of saying can it become and be such. Through the unsaid we first catch sight of the issue of thinking in its whole importance.

To achieve a first view into this space of freedom, in order to sharpen the glance into the essence of language already attempted, we restrict ourselves to a single state of affairs. It already became visible at the crossroads where the λóγος as thinking, in the sense of the λóγος ἀποφαντἰκóς, and the λóγος as talk, in the sense of saying, encounter each other. If we put this into a formula, then it concerns the relationship between thinking and language. The negotiations around this topic find no end, because they lack the right beginning. What is missing? The insight that thinking cannot be discussed in isolation on its own; for without a look to the relation of thinking to being we always have merely a fragment of the essence of thinking before us. If we indeed make the relation of language and thinking into a theme, then we must direct our meditation to the relationship between thinking and being and language. Then there appears at a stroke the whole quandary our enterprise has gotten itself into. For obviously thinking, being, and language cannot be placed together like three things. The relationship between thinking, being, and language never first arises in that we weave together the reciprocal relations between the three. The relationship that they hold to each other is rather something still unexperienced in which the belonging together of thinking, being, and language resonates. We still lack the view for this relationship, but also the ear for what the word here says. Nevertheless, we seek assistance to bring the relationship of these three into view and in so doing find out that we ourselves belong in this relationship in that we, as needed in the relationship, dwell in it and build on it. The relationship of thinking, being, and language therefore does not lie over against us. We ourselves are held within it. We can neither overtake it, nor even merely catch up with it, because we ourselves are caught up in this relationship. On this we would like to note that the elaborateness and awkwardness that our contemplation must go through do not merely stem from the limitations of our capacities, but instead are essential. This gives no right to whine about the wretchedness of the human, but is instead a cause for jubilation over the plenitude of the riddle that remains preserved for thinking.

But now how does the relationship between thinking, being, and language, in which we belong as the thinkers, join these together? We are not to lose sight of what the signpost ultimately revealed. Formally, it can be put so: Being and thinking, they themselves in their belonging together, are transposed back upon the λóγος as saying and thus back upon language. Language shows itself as the ground, thinking and being as its appearances. Thinking and being are grounded in language. It gives the relation its hold.16

Indeed, when we present the state of affairs in this way, do we not fall back into the conception of ground and grounding, now when we are supposed to be residing in the region of the abyss? But even if for the moment we are not disturbed by this falling back, we will nevertheless oppose the suggestion that we conceive language as the ground for being and thinking.

Language, whether conceived as speaking or talking or saying, is an activity of the human. Can being ever be explained as a production of the human? Evidently not. This is sooner the case for thinking, insofar as the human thinks because he speaks. Or does he speak because he thinks? Or do neither of these adequately hold? In the meantime, another way is proffered to concede an exceptional role to language in the whole of the relationship between thinking, being, and language. When one conceives language as the expression of something and as a sign for something, then it emerges that being is language, insofar as being is spoken through language. Thinking is language, insofar as it is expressed in speaking. For a long time now, and not without basis, one has used the representation of signs as an aid for conceiving what is linguistic of language. For this reason, we can by no means take lightly this long-established respect in which language becomes visible almost as of its own accord right when one asks what it would be. Not even when we have acknowledged that this respect, which represents language to us as expression, remains the most ensnaring obstruction for an entrance [Einkehr]17 into the essence of language.

But now it is worth noting that this sweeping accomplishment, which certainly pertains to language as expression for being and thinking, nonetheless does not hit upon what is thought when we say: The essence of language is what does the holding in the relationship that holds being and thinking to each other in their belonging together. This utterance, if it is one, retains its bewildering character. We are sooner inclined to arrange the relationship just named otherwise and say: Language and thinking are grounded in being; for while both are something extant, being has the character of ground. Language and thinking are grounded in being, without this they would be nothing.

Indeed, in the same instant we are also reminded: Being as ground determines thinking as a founding. This relation between ground and founding stems from the primordial conflict of Λóγος. But according to the directive of the signpost that reaches furthest back, the Λóγος is a talking, saying. Accordingly there reigns in the primordial conflict of the Λóγος, as what is genuinely contentious, the λóγος in the sense of saying. However dark and foreign to us the relation between language, thinking, and being may appear, it reveals a cast and trait that we have to face if we do not want to high-handedly disregard the signpost and its directing ability.

If we take a more sustained look into what is indicated there, then it cannot escape us that the λóγος does not appear there as language in the sense of a speaking vocalization, as expression. The λóγος is a saying in the sense of a letting appear. We must18 discuss language in regard to saying when we search for its essence and should no longer elucidate and explain it as a speech activity.

The discussion now necessary harbors within it the leap of thinking into its abyss—into the essence of language. Here “essence” no longer means ground of possibility, no longer essentia, essentiality as the highest species, no longer the τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι of Aristotle, no longer “essence” in the sense of Hegel’s logic. Essence is a persevering as a granting and this an appropriating [das Ereignen]. The essencing of language as saying is the realm [Be-reich]. This word is here claimed as a singulare tantum. It names something singular, that wherein all things and beings extend to one another [zu-gereicht], reach over [überreicht], and thus reach [erreichen] one another, and redound [gereichen] to the benefit and detriment of each other, fulfill [ausreichen] and satisfy one another.19

This20 realm alone is likewise home to the unattainable [das Unerreichbare]. The realm, now to be experienced as the essencing of language, is the dominion [Reich] of play, wherein all relationships of things and beings playfully solicit each other and mirror each other. Saying is reaching in the sense of the realm [des Be-reichs]. The reference to this only allows us to distantly intimate the essence of language as saying. The realm is the location in which thinking and being belong together.

The location is itself the relationship of the two. This relationship was earlier indicated by the phrase: Language is the house of being.21 “House” here means precisely what the word says: protection, guardianship, container [Be-hältnis], relationship [Ver-hältnis]. In the talk of the house of being, “being” means being itself.22 But this means precisely the belonging together with thinking, the belonging-together that first determines being as being. In the phrase just cited, “language” is not conceived as speaking and thus not as a mere activity of the human, but rather as house, i.e., as protection, as relationship.

The relationship is repeatedly pointed to by another citation, which says: Language speaks and not the human.23 The human speaks only insofar as he corresponds to language.

Language speaks. At first, this sounds like a tautology, outside of which one cannot conceive how language is supposed to speak, since indeed it itself is not equipped with speech organs. What proffers itself as a tautology, however, i.e., that language speaks, is the indication that the essence of language itself is playful, though it thereby does not get tangled up in itself, but releases itself into the free space of that inceptual freedom that is determined by itself alone.

We come closer to this state of affairs by contemplating the realm as the relationship which holds open the belonging together of thinking and being. Indeed, in the words “language speaks” what does this “speaks” mean if it cannot mean “speaking” in the sense of the activity of speech organs?

Language speaks as pronouncement [Spruch], as appeal [Zuspruch], and as claim [Anspruch]. Language is so playful that speaking, as in this case, means the same as saying. Otherwise linguistic doctrine teaches something else in explaining that the verbs “to speak” and “to talk” can be used absolutely [intransitively], in distinction from the verb “to say.” In saying there constantly lies a relation to something to be said and to what is said. Saying is relative to that [transitive]. If we consider more closely the sense of the verbs “to speak,” “to talk,” “to say,” then we must surely emphasize against linguistic doctrine that ever only in saying does the whole essence of language come to appearance, and in this sense absolutely so. Only externally, grammatically represented, are speaking and talking used absolutely [intransitively], i.e., here: separated and cut off from the whole essence of language.

One speaks. Someone talks. . . . He rattles on perhaps because he has nothing to say. And one speaks endlessly and it all says nothing. Contrariwise, one can be silent and in such a way say much, while there is no silence that speaks. Even the speechless gesture, precisely this, resonates in saying, not because there is a language of gestures and forms, but because the essence of language lies in saying. Gestures are not at first mere gestures that subsequently express something and then become a language, rather gestures are in themselves what they are through saying, wherein their bearing, enduring, and conveying each time remain already gathered. Gestural bearing is determined by saying and is thereby constantly the resonance of restraint. The gestural first attunes all movements. The nonessence of the gesture is the gesticulation. Pure gestures are speechless, but they are not wordless. They are so little this that they constantly are achieved24 in terms of and through such a saying. The nonspeaking essence of language resonates in saying. Saying constantly says something and only thereby from time to time also says nothing. Saying something is invariably and simultaneously a saying to a hearing. Language speaks from out of a saying. The essence of language is the saying [die Sage]. We use this word “saying” now—like many words of our language—mostly in a disparaging sense: saying as mere saying, something not confirmed and thereby unbelievable. Saying is not so meant here, if this word is to hint at the essence of language. It is meant more in the sense of legend, which as fable [Mär] is connected with the fairy tale [Märchen]. The essence of language is presumably the genuinely fabulous [Märchenhafte].

We humans can only say insofar as we are already accorded, promised, to the essence of language as saying. Indeed what does “saying” authentically mean? We attain a first answer by listening to what the Greek λἐγειν and λóγος say: appearing—and letting appear—conjuring. The same is meant by our25 word sagan; it means to show, to point, to see—and to let be perceived. Saying is a disclosive-concealing showing and pointing, a so-defined extending toward . . . , and a reaching back and forth. Saying is the realm [Be-reich] of this hinting-showing reaching.

Showing, according to its original26 essence, precisely does not have need of signs, i.e., showing is not merely the use of signs, but rather showing as letting appear first makes possible the institution and use27 of signs. Only because language is in its essence saying, a showing in the original sense,28 are there vocal signs and written signs for talking and speaking. Only because language is in its essence saying and as such shows, can this showing become a letting be seen of views and points of view, which we name images and which writing evokes not only as phonetic writing, but also as pictographic writing.29

Only through an adequate discussion of saying can we understand the original λóγος -character of thinking. Thinking is in its essence saying. Poetizing is singing. Every singing is a saying, but not every saying a singing.

The etymology of “saying” goes back to the Indo-Germanic sequ, which recurs in the Greek ἐπ—ἔπος—ενἔπε and is to be heard in the first verse of Homer’s Odyssey: “Ανδῥα μοι ἔννεπε, Μούσα, πολύτῥοπὄν;30 “Say to me of that man, muse, the one much driven about.” The muse sings in that she says and addresses the saying to the singer. So construed, then, song and thought, the collection of singing and of thinking respectively, are both at home in the same essence, in what is legendary of the saying [Sagenhaften der Sage]. Thus, for example, Antigone and Oedipus and Tiresias in the dramas of Sophocles have not spoken as psychologically trained speakers, instead they have said and thereby have sung. In saying they let appear what they have caught sight of, namely that which has sighted them themselves.

From the foregoing discussion, thoughts about language that we heard from the German Classic and Romantic period become understandable, for example, the saying of Johann Georg Hamann: “Poesy is the mother-tongue of the human race.”31 Accordingly the essence of language would have to be understood from the essence of poetry. Such was said in the lecture “Hölderlin and the Essence of Poetry” from 1936.32 But from where is the essence of poetry to be thought? From what is legendary of the realm that first gives thinking and poetizing over to their respective essences.

Thus we would have to think that saying of Hölderlin which hints at a great deal, “Poetically dwells / the human on this earth,” still more deeply by a leap in order to make it wholly our own. The human dwells poetically because he is legendarily accorded [sagenhaft . . . zugesagt] to the essence of language as saying [der Sage].

We do not come near to the relationship that holds poetizing and thinking apart and together as long as we stretch it across the rack of the relationship between poesy and philosophy.

Grounding-principles of thinking are leaps into the essence of language, which we name “saying.” What is legendary of them is that manifold reaching as which the realm resonates in itself. The realm is the location of the identity of thinking and being.

Thinking is saying, but not necessarily talking and speaking and writing. Thinking is saying, but not necessarily utterance in the sense of the λóγος ἀποφαντικóς of logic, not necessarily a talking through in the sense of λἐγειν as the δἰαλἐγεσθαι of dialectic.

Admittedly, we have very little to say of the essence of saying and its legendary character. We would first have to experience and withstand what is most bewildering: That before all being and thinking, and before the belonging-together of both of these, the essence of language is the play of the location, resonating in itself, for this belonging-together. As such a realm [Bereich], the saying hands over [überreicht] all things and beings to one another and thus extends [darreicht] them to us such that we everywhere encounter [erreichen] them or miss them.

But it would indeed be even more bewildering if what was bewildering of the legendary realm—language’s essence, playful in itself—had flashed up here and there and, in the interim, we did not learn—on long paths to be sure—to occasionally catch sight of the afterglow of such flashes. The testimonial of one such flash may be cited in conclusion. The title reads “Monologue”; the text runs:

There is really something very foolish about speaking and writing; proper conversation is merely a word game. One can only marvel at the ridiculous mistake that people make when they think—that they speak for the sake of things. The particular quality of language, the fact that it is concerned only with itself, is known to no one. Language is such a marvelous and fruitful secret—because when someone speaks merely for the sake of speaking, he utters the most splendid, most original truths. But if he wants to speak about something definite, capricious language makes him say the most ridiculous and confused stuff. This is also the cause of the hatred that so many serious people feel toward language. They notice the mischief 〈i.e. the inclination of language to wantonness〉, but not the fact that the chattering they scorn is the infinitely serious aspect of language. If one could only make people understand that it is the same with language as with mathematical formulae. These constitute a world of their own. They play only with themselves, express nothing but their own marvelous nature, and just for this reason they are so expressive—just for this reason the strange play of relations between things is mirrored in them. Only through their freedom are they elements of nature and only in their free movements does the world-soul manifest itself in them and make them a sensitive measure and ground plan of things. So it is with language, too— on the one hand, anyone who is sensitive to its fingering, its rhythm, its musical spirit, who perceives within himself the delicate working of its inner nature, and moves his tongue or his hand accordingly, will be a prophet; on the other hand, anyone who knows how to write truths like these but does not have ear and sense enough for it will be outwitted by language itself and mocked by people as Cassandra was by the Trojans. Even if in saying this I believe I have described the essence and office of poesy in the clearest possible way, at the same time I know that no one can understand it, and I have said something quite foolish because I wanted to say it, and in this way no poesy comes about. What would it be like though if I had to speak? and this instinct of language to speak were the hallmark of what inspires language, of the efficacy of language within me? and were my will to want only everything that I was obliged to do, in the end could this be poesy without my knowledge or belief and could it make a secret of language understandable? and thus I would be a born writer, for a writer is surely only a language enthusiast?



The testimonial stems from Friedrich von Hardenberg (Novalis); it is the sketch of a contribution for the Athenäum and was written in 1799–1800.33 Much remains dark and confusing in this monologue of λóγος, especially since he thinks in another direction and speaks in another language than what is attempted in these lectures.

In the meantime, the consideration has certainly already established itself that here language, or indeed its essence, would be made absolute. So it appears in fact as long as we, insisting on representation, take the essence of language for something present-at-hand and pre-given, instead of leaping into that relationship34 that the saying is as the realm, a relationship in which we ourselves are included.

A look to this, however, charges our thinking with once again examining whether the states of affairs named by the words “relationship,” “realm,” “saying,” “event of appropriation” are still to be represented by concepts. A meditation is roused as to whether a thinking is not required whose language would correspond to the essence of the saying and the saying of essence and therefore would not be able to make use of modified metaphysical terminology. This other thinking must listen back into the unspent vocabulary of our language wherein an unused saying waits in order to help the thinking of what is unthought come into words. Yet this vocabulary by itself can never take away from thinking the risk of its path.

Thinking, however, does not deliver itself over to language, but situates the essence of language in the essential provenance of saying, that relationship within which we are included.

We remain settled upon this earth in relationality. Someone who is only concerned with being right, instead of with the experience of the issue and its claim, could counter to this: Then the relational is precisely the absolute. Correct. But the question surely remains whether we get along in thinking with what is merely correct and with the help of what is correct can ever say what this would then mean: absolute.

For now, another consideration weighs more heavily. When we say: The abyss of thinking is the essence of language. Its essence is the saying. The saying is the realm of the hinting-showing reaching. The realm is as the location of the belonging together of thinking and being—when we say this, it appears as though we only followed a chain of utterances. What so appears and can even be taken exclusively in this way every time is nevertheless simultaneously a hint into a saying that encircles itself and thereby directly remains open, just like a ring, which as a ring is indeed closed, but precisely as closed preserves all around a light and free space wherein perhaps something unsaid might make an address without showing itself.

There is a conversation about painting that discusses to what extent what is painted in color only contains a sketch and outline of the image that it forms, but is supposed to contain these in such a manner that the sketch in the image does not properly show itself.
