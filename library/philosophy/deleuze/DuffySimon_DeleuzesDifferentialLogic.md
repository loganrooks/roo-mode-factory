# The mathematics of Deleuze's differential logic and metaphysics[^1]
Simon Duffy

In Difference and Repetition, Deleuze explores the manner by means of
which concepts are implicated in the problematic Idea by using a mathematics
problem as an example, the elements of which are the differentials
of the differential calculus. What I would like to offer in this essay is a
historical account of the mathematical problematic that Deleuze deploys
in his philosophy, and an introduction to the role played by this problematic
in the development of his philosophy of difference. One of the
points of departure that I will take from the history of mathematics is the
theme of ‘power series’ (Deleuze 1994, 114), which will involve a
detailed elaboration of the mechanism through which power series operate
in the differential calculus deployed by Deleuze in Difference and
Repetition. Deleuze actually constructs an alternative history of mathematics
that establishes a historical continuity between the differential
point of view of the infinitesimal calculus and modern theories of the
differential calculus. It is in relation to this differential point of view that
Deleuze determines a differential logic which he deploys, in the form of
a logic of different/ciation, in the development of his project of constructing
a philosophy of difference.

## The differential point of view of the infinitesimal calculus.
The concept of the differential was introduced by developments in the
infinitesimal calculus during the later part of the seventeenth century.
Carl Boyer, in The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development,
describes the early stages of this development as being ‘bound up
with concepts of geometry ... and with explanations of the infinitely
small’ (1959, 11). Boyer presents the infinitesimal calculus as dealing
with ‘the infinite sequences obtained by continuing to diminish ad
infinitum the intervals between the values of the independent variable.
... By means of these successive subdivisions the smallest possible
intervals or differentials are obtained]’ (p. 12). The differential can
therefore be understood to be the infinitesimal difference between consecutive
values of a continuously diminishing quantity. Boyer refers to
this early form of the infinitesimal calculus as the infinitesimal calculus
from ‘the differential point of view’ (p. 12). From this point of view,
Boyer argues that, ‘the derivative would be defined as the quotient of
two such differentials, and the integral would then be the sum of a
number (perhaps finite, perhaps infinite) of such differentials’ (p. 12).
The infinitesimal calculus consists of two branches which are
inverse operations: differential calculus, which is concerned with calculating
derivatives, or differential relations; and integral calculus, which is
concerned with integration, or the calculation of the infinite sum of the
differentials. The derivative, from the differential point of view of the
infinitesimal calculus, is the quotient of two differentials, that is, a differential
relation, of the type dy/dx. The differential, dy, is an infinitely
small quantity, or what Deleuze describes as ‘a vanishing quantity’
(1981): a quantity smaller than any given or givable quantity. Therefore,
as a vanishing quantity, dy, in relation to y, is, strictly speaking, equal to
zero. In the same way, dx, in relation to x, is, strictly speaking, equal to
zero, that is, dx is the vanishing quantity of x. Given that y is a quantity
of the abscissa, and that x is a quantity of the ordinate, dy = 0 in relation
to the abscissa, and dx = 0 in relation to the ordinate. The differential relation
can therefore be written as dy/dx = 0/0. However, although dy is
nothing in relation to y, and dx is nothing in relation to x, dy over dx does
not cancel out, that is, dy/dx is not equal to zero. When the differentials
are represented as being equal to zero, the relation can no longer be said
to exist since the relation between two zeros is zero, that is 0/0 = 0; there
is no relation between two things which do not exist. However, the differentials
do actually exist.[^2] They exist as vanishing quantities insofar as
they continue to vanish as quantities rather than having already vanished
as quantities. Therefore, despite the fact that, strictly speaking, they equal
zero, they are still not yet, or not quite equal to, zero. The relation
between these two differentials, dy/dx, therefore does not equal zero,
dy/dx ≠ 0, despite the fact that dy/dx = 0/0. Instead, the differential relation
itself, dy/dx, subsists as a relation. ‘What subsists when dy and dx
cancel out under the form of vanishing quantities is the relation dy/dx
itself’ (1981). Despite the fact that its terms vanish, the relation itself is
nonetheless real. It is here that Deleuze considers seventeenth century
logic to have made a ‘a fundamental leap’, by determining ‘a logic of relations’
(1981). He argues that ‘under this form of infinitesimal calculus is
discovered a domain where the relations no longer depend on their terms’
(1981). The concept of the infinitely small as vanishing quantities allows
the determination of relations independently of their terms. ‘The differential
relation presents itself as the subsistence of the relation when the
terms vanish’ (1981). According to Deleuze, ‘the terms between which
the relation establishes itself are neither determined, nor determinable,
Only the relation between its terms is determined’ (1981). This is the
logic of relations that Deleuze locates in the infinitesimal calculus of the
seventeenth century.
The differential relation, which Deleuze characterises as a ‘pure
relation’ (1981) because it is independent of its terms, and which subsists
insofar as dy/dx ≠ 0, has a perfectly expressible finite quantity designated
by a third term, z, such that dy/dx equals z. Deleuze argues that ‘when you
have a [differential] relation derived from a circle, this relation doesn’t
involve the circle at all but refers [rather] to what is called a tangent’
(1981). A tangent is a straight line that touches a circle or curve at only
one point. The gradient of a tangent indicates the rate of change of the
curve at that point, that is, the rate at which the curve changes on the y-axis
relative to the x-axis. The differential relation therefore serves in the
determination of this third term, z, the value of which is the gradient of
the tangent to the circle or curve.
When referring to the geometrical study of curves in his early
mathematical manuscripts, Leibniz writes that ‘the differential calculus
could be employed with diagrams in an even more wonderfully simple
manner than it was with numbers’ (Leibniz 1920, 53). Leibniz presents
one such diagram in a paper entitled ‘Justification of the Infinitesimal
Calculus by That of Ordinary Algebra’, when he offers an example of
what had already been established of the infinitesimal calculus in relation
to particular problems before the greater generality of its methods were
developed (Leibniz 1969, 545). An outline of the example that Leibniz
gives is as follows:
since the two right triangles, ZFE and ZHJ, that meet at their apex, point
Z, are similar, it follows that the ratio y/x is equal to (Y - y)/X. As the
straight line EJ approaches point F, maintaining the same angle at the
variable point Z, the lengths of the straight lines FZ and FE, or y and x,
steadily diminish, yet the ratio of y to x remains constant. When the
straight line EJ passes through F, the points E and Z coincide with F, and
the straight lines, y and x, vanish. Yet y and x will not be absolutely
nothing since they preserve the ratio of ZH to HJ, represented by the proportion
(Y - y)/X, which in this case reduces to Y/X, and obviously does
not equal zero. The relation y/x continues to exist even though the terms
have vanished since the relation is determinable as equal to Y/X. In this
algebraic calculus, the vanished lines x and y are not taken for zeros since
they still have an algebraic relation to each other. ‘And so,’ Leibniz
argues, ‘they are treated as infinitesimals, exactly as one of the elements
which differential calculus recognises in the ordinates of curves for
momentary increments and decrements’ (1969, 545). That is, the vanished
lines x and y are determinable in relation to each other only insofar
as they can be replaced by the infinitesimals dy and dx, by making the
supposition that the ratio y/x is equal to the ratio of the infinitesimals,
dy/dx. In the first published account of the calculus, Leibniz defines the
ratio of infinitesimals as the quotient of first-order differentials, or the
differential relation. He says that ‘the differential dx of the abscissa is
an arbitrary quantity, and that the differential dy of the ordinate y is
defined as the quantity which is to dx as the ratio of the ordinate to the
subtangent’ (Boyer 1959, 210). Leibniz considers differentials to be
the fundamental concepts of the infinitesimal calculus, the differential
relation being defined in terms of these differentials.

## A new theory of relations

Leibniz recognised integration to be a process not only of summation, but
also of the inverse transformation of differentiation, so the integral is
not only the sum of differentials, but also the inverse of the differential
relation. In the early nineteenth century, the process of integration as a
summation was overlooked by most mathematicians in favour of determining
integration, instead, as the inverse transformation of differentiation.
The main reason for this was that by extending sums to an infinite
number of terms, problems began to emerge if the series did not
converge. The value or sum of an infinite series is only determinable if
the series converges. Divergent series have no sum. It was considered
that reckoning with divergent series would therefore lead to false results.
The problem of integration as a process of summation from the differential
point of view of the infinitesimal calculus did, however, continue to
be explored. It was Augustin Cauchy (b.1789 - 1857) who first introduced
specific tests for the convergence of series, so that divergent series
could henceforth be excluded from being used to try to solve problems of
integration because of their propensity to lead to false results (Boyer
1959,287).
The object of the process of integration in general is to determine
from the coefficients of the given function of the differential relation the
original function from which they were derived. Put simply, given a relation
between two differentials, dy/dx, the problem of integration is to find
a relation between the quantities y and x, themselves. This problem corresponds
to the geometrical method of finding the function of a curve
characterised by a given property of its tangent. The differential relation
is thought of as another function which describes, at each point on an
original function, the gradient of the line tangent to the curve at that
point. The value of this ‘gradient’ indicates a specific quality of the original
function; its rate of change at that point. The differential relation
therefore indicates the specific qualitative nature of the original function
at different points on the curve.
The inverse process to integration is differentiation, which, in geometrical
terms, determines the differential relation as the function of the
tangent to a given curve. Put simply, to determine the tangent to a
curve at a specified point, a second point that satisfies the function of the
curve is selected, and the gradient of the line that runs through both of
these points is calculated. As the second point approaches the point of
tangency, the gradient of the line between the two points approaches the
gradient of the tangent. The gradient of the tangent is, therefore, the limit
of the gradient of the line between the two points as the points become
infinitesimally close to one another.
It was Newton who first came up with this concept of a limit. He conceptualised
the tangent geometrically, as the limit of a sequence of lines
between two points, P and Q, on a curve, which he called a secant. As the
distance between the points approached zero, the secants became progressively
smaller, however they always retained ‘a real length'. The
secant therefore approached the tangent without reaching it. When this
distance ‘got arbitrarily small (but remained a real number)’ (Lakoff and
Nunez 2000, 224), it was considered insignificant for practical purposes,
and was ignored. What is different in Leibniz’s method is that he
'hypothesized infinitely small numbers - infinitesimals - to designate the
size of infinitely small intervals’ (p. 224). For Newton, on the contrary,
these intervals remained only small, and therefore real. When performing
calculations, however, both approaches yielded the same results. But
they differed ontologically, because Leibniz had hypothesised a new kind
of number, a number Newton did not need, since ‘his secants always had
a real length, while Leibniz’s had an infinitesimal length’ (p. 224).
For the next two hundred years, various attempts were made to find
a rigorous arithmetic foundation for the calculus. One that relied on
neither the mathematical intuition of geometry, with its tangents and
secants, which was perceived as imprecise because its conception of
limits was not properly understood; nor the vagaries of the infinitesimal,
which made many mathematicians wary, so much so that they refused
the hypothesis outright, despite the fact that Leibniz ‘could do calculus
using arithmetic without geometry - by using infinitesimal numbers’
(pp. 224-5).
What is at stake in the debate on the legitimacy of the infinitesimal
is ‘the integration of the infinitesimal into the register of quantity’ (Salanskis
1996, 71), that is, of the infinite in the finite, which comes down to
the alternative between infinite and finite representations. This is precisely
what is at issue in what Deleuze describes as ‘the “metaphysics”
of the calculus’ (Deleuze 1994,176). Throughout the eighteenth century,
there was disagreement as to the particular kind of ‘metaphysics’ by
which ‘to rescue the procedures of the calculus’ from the vagaries of the
infinitesimal. In speaking of the history of the differential calculus,
Giorello argues that ‘it was indeed a matter of rival metaphysical frameworks
that provided the basis for widely differing programs’ (1992,160).
It was not until the late nineteenth century, that an adequate solution
to this problem of rigour was posed. It was Karl Weierstrass (b. 1815
– 1897) who ‘developed a pure nongeometric arithmetization for
Newtonian calculus’ (Lakoff and Nunez 2000, 230), which provided
the rigour that had been lacking. The Weierstrassian program was
determined by the following question: ‘is the fate of calculus tied to infinitesimals,
or must it not be given a rigorous status from the point of view
of finite representations?’ (Deleuze 1994,177). ‘Weierstrass’ theory was
an updated version of Cauchy’s earlier account’ (Lakoff and Nunez 2000,
309), which had also experienced problems conceptualising limits.
Cauchy actually begs the question of the concept of limit in his proof.[^3] In
order to overcome this problem of conceptualising limits, Weierstrass
‘sought to eliminate all geometry from the study of derivatives and
integrals in calculus’ (p. 309). In order to characterise calculus purely in
terms of arithmetic, it was necessary for the idea of a function, as a curve
in the Cartesian plane defined in terms of the motion of a point, to be
completely replaced with the idea of a function that is, rather, a set of
ordered pairs of real numbers. The geometric idea of ‘approaching a
limit’ had to be replaced by an arithmetized concept of limit that relied
on static logical constraints on numbers alone. This approach is commonly
referred to as the epsilon-delta method. Deleuze argues that ‘It is
Weierstrass who bypasses all the interpretations of the differential calculus
from Leibniz to Lagrange, by saying that it has nothing to do with a
process Weierstrass gives an interpretation of the differential and
infinitesimal calculus which he himself calls static, where there is no
longer fluctuation towards a limit, nor any idea of threshold’ (Deleuze
1972). The calculus was thereby reformulated without either geometric
secants and tangents or infinitesimals; only the real numbers were used.
Because there is no reference to infinitesimals in this Weierstrassian
definition of the calculus, the designation ‘the infinitesimal calculus’
was considered to be ‘inappropriate’ (Boyer 1959, 287). Weierstrass’
work not only effectively removed any remnants of geometry from what
was now referred to as the differential calculus, but it eliminated the use
of Leibnizian-inspired infinitesimal arithmetic in doing the calculus
for over half a century. It was not until the late 1960’s, with the development
of the controversial axioms of non-standard analysis by Abraham
Robinson (b. 1918–1974), that the infinitesimal was given a rigorous
foundation (see Bell 1998), and a formal theory of the infinitesimal
calculus was constructed, thus allowing Leibniz’s ideas to be ‘fully vindicated’
(Robinson 1996, 2), as Newton’s had been thanks to Weierstrass.
As far as Deleuze is concerned, it is no longer a question of reluctantly
tolerating the ‘inexactitude’ of the infinitesimal. They must rather
be ‘separated from [their] infinitesimal matrix’ (Deleuze 1994,171), that
is, from their static representation as numbers, which eludes even the
axioms of non-standard analysis, and this is effected by means of their
implication in differential relations according to the logic of the differential
from the differential point of view of the infinitesimal calculus.
The undetermined differentials, or infinitesimals, dy or dx, are only
determinable insofar as each is involved in a differential relation with
another, that is, in reciprocal relation to one another, dy/dx. What counts
is that it is within the differential relation itself that the differential possesses
rigour and coherence; that the undetermined are determinable, by
a process of reciprocal determination.
The Deleuzian solution to the debate over the legitimacy of the
infinitesimal distinguishes itself from the Weierstrassian solution insofar
as it is not resolved according to the program of discretization. Rather
than representing one by means of the other, Deleuze argues that the
alternative between infinite and finite representations, and therefore the
metaphysics of the calculus, are ‘strictly immanent to the techniques of
the calculus itself’ (Deleuze 1994,176).
It is specifically in relation to these developments that Deleuze
contends that, when understood from the differential point of view of that
infinitesimal calculus, the value of z, which was determined by Leibniz
in relation to the differential relation, dy/dx, as the gradient of the tangent,
functions as a limit. When the relation establishes itself between infinitely
small terms, it does not cancel itself out with its terms, but rather
tends towards a limit. In other words, when the terms of the differential
relation vanish, the relation subsists because it tends towards a limit.[^4]
Since the differential relation approaches more closely to its limit as the
differentials decrease in size, or approach zero, the limit of the relation is
represented by the relation between the infinitely small. Of course,
despite the geometrical nature of the idea of a variable and a limit, where
variables ‘decrease in size’ or ‘approach zero’ and the differential relation
‘approaches’ or ‘tends towards’ a limit, they are not essentially
dynamic, but involve purely static considerations, that is, they are rather
‘to be taken automatically as a kind of shorthand for the corresponding
developments of the epsilon-delta approach’ (Lakoff and Nunez 2000,
277). It is in this sense that the differential relation between the infinitely
small refers to something finite. Or, as Deleuze suggests, it is in the finite
itself that there is the ‘mutual immanence’ (1981) of the relation and the
infinitely small.
Given that the method of integration provides a way of working
back from the differential relation, the problem of integration is, therefore,
how to reverse this process of differentiation. This can be solved by
determining the inverse of the given differential relation according to the
inverse transformation of differentiation. Or, a solution can be determined
from the differential point of view of the infinitesimal calculus by
considering integration as a process of summation in the form of a series,
according to which, given the specific qualitative nature of a tangent at a
point, the problem becomes that of finding, not just one other point determinative
of the differential relation, but a sequence of points, all of which
together satisfy, or generate, a curve and therefore a function in the
neighbourhood of the given point of tangency, which therefore functions
as the limit of the function.
Deleuze considers this to be the base of the infinitesimal calculus
as understood or interpreted in the seventeenth century. The formula for
the problem of the infinite that Deleuze extracts from this seventeenth
century understanding of the infinitesimal calculus, is that 'something
finite consists of an infinity under a certain relation’ (1981). Deleuze
considers this formula to mark ‘an equilibrium point, for seventeenthcentury
thought, between the infinite and the finite, by means of a new
theory of relations’ (1981). It is the logic of this theory of relations that
provides a starting point for the investigation into the logic that Deleuze
deploys in Difference and Repetition as part of his project of constructing
a philosophy of difference.

## The logic of the differential.

Having located the logic of the differential from the differential point of
view of the infinitesimal calculus in the work of Leibniz, the subsequent
developments that this logic undergoes will now be examined in relation to
the work of some of the key figures in the history of this branch of
the infinitesimal calculus. These figures are implicated in an alternative lineage
in the history of mathematics by means of which the differential point
of view of the infinitesimal calculus is aligned with the differential calculus
of contemporary mathematics. The logic of the differential from the differential
point of view of the infinitesimal calculus is then implicated in the
development of Deleuze’s project of constructing a philosophy of difference.
The manner by means of which these figures are implicated in an
alternative lineage in the history of mathematics will now be examined.
Ironically, one of the mathematicians who contributed to the
development of the differential point of view is Karl Weierstrass, who
considers the differential relation to be logically prior to the function in
the process of determination associated with the infinitesimal calculus,
that is, rather than determining the differential relation from a given function,
the kinds of mathematical problems with which Weierstrass dealt
involved investigating how to generate a function from a given differential
relation. Weierstrass develops a theory of integration as the approximation
of functions from differential relations according to a process of
summation in the form of series. Despite Weierstrass having eliminated
both geometry and the infinitesimal from the calculus, Deleuze recovers
this theory in order to restore the Leibnizian perspective of the differential,
as the genetic force of the differential relation, to the differential
point of view of the infinitesimal calculus, by means of the infinitesimal
axioms of non-standard analysis.
According to Deleuze’s reading of the infinitesimal calculus from
the differential point of view, a function does not precede the differential
relation, but is rather determined by the differential relation. The differential
relation is used to determine the overall shape of the curve of a
function primarily by determining the number and distribution of its distinctive
points, which are points of articulation where the nature of the
curve changes or the function alters its behaviour. For example, in
geometrical terms, when the differential relation is zero, the gradient of
the tangent at that point is horizontal, indicating that the curve peaks or
dips, determining therefore a maximum or minimum at that point. These
distinctive points are known as stationary or turning points.
The differential relation characterises or qualifies not only the distinctive
points which it determines, but also the nature of the regular points in the
immediate neighbourhood of these points, that is, the shape of the
branches of the curve between each distinctive point. Where the differential
relation gives the value of the gradient at the distinctive point, the
value of the derivative of the differential relation, that is, the second
derivative, indicates the rate at which the gradient is changing at that
point, which allows a more accurate approximation of the nature of the
function in the neighbourhood of that point. The value of the third derivative
indicates the rate at which the second derivative is changing at that
point. In fact, the more successive derivatives that can be evaluated at the
distinctive point, the more accurate will be the approximation of the
function in the immediate neighbourhood of that point.
This method of approximation using successive derivatives is
formalised in the calculus according to Weierstrass’ theory by a Taylor
series or power series expansion. A power series expansion can be
written as a polynomial, the coefficients of each of its terms being the
successive derivatives evaluated at the distinctive point. The sum of such
a series represents the expanded function provided that any remainder
approaches zero as the number of terms becomes infinite; the polynomial
then becomes an infinite series which converges with the function in the
neighbourhood of the distinctive point.[^5] This criterion of convergence
repeats Cauchy’s earlier exclusion of divergent series from the calculus.
A power series operates at each distinctive point by successively determining
the specific qualitative nature of the function at that point. The
power series determines not only the specific qualitative nature of the
function at the point in question, but also the specific qualitative nature
of all of the regular points in the neighbourhood of that distinctive point,
such that the specific qualitative nature of a function in the neighbourhood
of a distinctive point insists in that one point. By examining the
relation between the differently distributed distinctive points determined
by the differential relation, the regular points which are continuous
between the distinctive points, that is, in geometrical terms, the branches
of the curve, can be determined. In general, the power series converges
with a function by generating a continuous branch of a curve in the neighbourhood
of a distinctive point. To the extent that all of the regular points
are continuous across all of the different branches generated by the power
series of the distinctive points, the entire complex curve or the whole
analytic function is generated.
So, according to Deleuze’s reading of the infinitesimal calculus,
the differential relation is generated by differentials and the power series
are generated in a process involving the repeated differentiation of the
differential relation. It is due to these processes that a function is generated
in the first place. The mathematical elements of this interpretation
are most clearly developed by Weierstrassian analysis, according to the
theorem on the approximation of analytic functions. An analytic function,
being secondary to the differential relation, is differentiable, and
therefore continuous, at each point of its domain. According to Weierstrass,
for any continuous function on a given interval, or domain, there
exists a power series expansion which uniformly converges to this function
on the given domain. Given that a power series approximates a
function in such a restricted domain, the task is then to determine other
power series expansions that approximate the same function in other
domains. An analytic function is differentiable at each point of its
domain, and is essentially defined for Weierstrass from the neighbourhood
of a distinctive point by a power series expansion which is
convergent with a ‘circle of convergence’ around that point. A power
series expansion that is convergent in such a circle represents a function
that is analytic at each point in the circle. By taking a point interior to
the first circle as a new centre, and by determining the values of the
coefficients of this new series using the function generated by the first
series, a new series and a new centre of convergence are obtained, whose
circle of convergence overlaps the first. The new series is continuous
with the first if the values of the function coincide in the common part of
the two circles. This method of ‘analytic continuity’ allows the gradual
construction of a whole domain over which the generated function is
continuous. At the points of the new circle of convergence which are
exterior to, or extend outside the first, the function represented by the
second series is then the analytic continuation of the function defined by
the first series; what Weierstrass defines as the analytic continuation of a
power series expansion outside its circle of convergence. The domain of
the function is extended by the successive adjunction of more and more
circles of convergence. Each series expansion which determines a circle
of convergence is called an element of the function (Kline 1972,643-4).
In this way, given an element of an analytic function, by analytic continuation
one can obtain the entire analytic function over an extended
domain. The analytic continuation of power series expansions can be
continued in this way in all directions up to the points in the immediate
neighbourhood exterior to the circles of convergence where the series
obtained diverge.
Power series expansions diverge at specific ‘singular points’ or
‘singularities’ that may arise in the process of analytic continuity. A
singular point or singularity of an analytic function is any point which is
not a regular or ordinary point of the function. They are points which
exhibit distinctive properties and thereby have a dominating and exceptional
role in the determination of the characteristics of the function.[^6] The
distinctive points of a function, which include the turning points, where
dy/dx = 0, and points of inflection, where d2y/dx2 = 0, are ‘removable singular
points’, since the power series at these points converge with the
function. A removable singular point is uniformly determined by the
function and therefore redefinable as a distinctive point of the function,
such that the function is analytic or continuous at that point. The specific
singularities of an analytic function where the series obtained diverge are
called ‘poles’ Singularities of this kind are those points where the function
no longer satisfies the conditions of regularity which assure its local
continuity, such that the rule of analytic continuity breaks down. They
are therefore points of discontinuity. A singularity is called a pole of a
function when the values of the differential relation, that is, the gradients
of the tangents to the points of the function, approach infinity as the function
approaches the pole. The function is said to be asymptotic to the
pole, it is therefore no longer differentiable at that point, but rather
remains undefined, or vanishes. A pole is therefore the limit point of a
function, and is referred to as an accumulation point or point of condensation.
A pole can also be referred to as a jump discontinuity in relation
to a finite discontinuous interval both within the same function, for example
periodic functions, and between neighbouring analytic functions.
Deleuze writes that ‘a singularity is the point of departure for a series
which extends over all the ordinary points of the system, as far as the
region of another singularity which itself gives rise to another series
which may either converge or diverge from the first’ (Deleuze 1994,
278). The singularities whose series converge are removable singular
points, and those whose series diverge are poles.
The singularities, or poles, that arise in the process of analytic continuity
necessarily lie on the boundaries of the circles of convergence of
power series. In the neighbourhood of a pole, a circle of convergence
extends as far as the pole in order to avoid including it, and the poles of
any neighbouring functions, within its domain. The effective domain of
an analytic function determined by the process of the analytic continuation
of power series expansions is therefore limited to that between its
poles. With this method the domain is not circumscribed in advance, but
results rather from the succession of local operations.
Power series can be used in this way to solve differential relations
by determining the analytic function into which they can be expanded.
Weierstrass developed his theory alongside the integral conception of
Cauchy, which further developed the inverse relation between the differential
and the integral calculus as the fundamental theorem of the
calculus. The fundamental theorem maintains that differentiation and
integration are inverse operations, such that integrals are computed by
finding anti-derivatives, which are otherwise known as primitive functions.
There are a large number of rules, or algorithms, according to
which this reversal is effected.
Deleuze presents Weierstrass’ theorem of approximation as an
effective method for determining the characteristics of a function from
the differential point of view of the infinitesimal calculus. The mathematician
Albert Lautman (b. 1908 - 1944) refers to this process as
integration from ‘the local point of view’, or simply as ‘local integration’
(Lautman 1938a, 38). This form of integration does not involve the determination
of the primitive function, which is generated by exercising the
inverse operation of integration. The development of a local point of
view, rather, requires the analysis of the characteristics of a function at its
singular points. The passage from the analytic function defined in the
neighbourhood of a singular point, to the analytic function defined is
each ordinary point is made according to the ideas of Weierstrass by
analytic continuity. This method was eventually deduced from the
Cauchy point of view, such that the Weierstrassian approach was no
longer emphasised. The unification of both of these points of view, however,
was achieved at the beginning of the twentieth century when the
rigour of Cauchy’s ideas, which were then fused with those of Georg
Riemann (b.1826 - 1866), the other major contributor to the development
of the theory of functions, was improved. Deleuze is therefore able
to cite the contribution of Weierstrass’ theorem of approximation in the
development of the differential point of view of the infinitesimal calculus
as an alternative point of view of the differential calculus to that
developed by Cauchy, and thereby establish a historical continuity
between Leibniz’s differential point of view of the infinitesimal calculus
and the differential calculus of contemporary mathematics, thanks to the
axioms of non-standard analysis which allow the inclusion of the infinitesimal
in its arithmetization.

## The development of a differential philosophy

While Deleuze draws inspiration and guidance from Salomon Maimon
(b. 1753 - 1800), who ‘sought to ground post Kantianism upon a Leibnizian
reinterpretation of the calculus’ (Deleuze 1994, 170), and ‘who
proposes a fundamental reformation of the Critique and an overcoming
of the Kantian duality between concept and intuition’ (Deleuze 1994,
173), it is in the work of Hoene Wronski (b.1778 - 1853) that Deleuze
finds the established expression of the first principle of the differential
philosophy. Wronski was ‘an eager devotee of the differential method of
Leibniz and of the transcendental philosophy of Kant’ (Boyer 1959,
261). Wronski made a transcendental distinction between the finite and
the infinitesimal, determined by the two heterogeneous functions of
knowledge, understanding and reason. He argued that ‘finite quantities
bear upon the objects of our knowledge, and infinitesimal quantities on
the very generation of this knowledge; such that each of these two classes
of knowledge must have laws proper [to themselves], and it is in the
distinction between these laws that the major thesis of the metaphysics of
infinitesimal quantities is to be found’ (Wronski 1814, 35; Blay 1998,
158). It is imperative not to confuse 'the objective laws of finite quantities
with the purely subjective laws of infinitesimal quantities’ (p. 36;
158). He claims that it is this 'confusion that is the source of the inexactitude
that is felt to be attached to the infinitesimal Calculus. This is
also [why] geometers, especially those of the present day, consider the
infinitesimal Calculus, which nonetheless they concede always gives true
results, to be only an indirect or artificial procedure’ (p. 36; 159). Wronski
is referring here to the work of Joseph-Louis Lagrange (b. 1736 -
1813) and Lazarre Carnot (b. 1753 - 1823), two of the major figures
in the history of the differential calculus, whose attempts to provide a
rigorous foundation for the differential calculus involved the elimination
of the infinitesimal from all calculations, or as Wronski argued, involved
confusing objective and subjective laws in favour of finite quantities (See
Blay 1998,159). Both of these figures count as precursors to the work of
Cauchy and Weierstrass. Wronski argued that the differential calculus
constituted ‘a primitive algorithm governing the generation of quantities,
rather than the laws of quantities already formed' (Boyer 1959, 262).
According to Wronski, the differential should be interpreted 'as having
an a priori metaphysical reality associated with the generation of magnitude’
(p. 262). The differential is therefore expressed as a pure element
of quantitability; insofar as it prepares for the determination of quantity.
The work of Wronski represents an extreme example of the differential
point of view of the infinitesimal calculus which recurs throughout the
nineteenth century.
Another significant figure in this alternative history of mathematics
that is constructed by Deleuze is Jean Baptiste Bordas-Demoulin
(b. 1798 - 1859), who also champions the infinitesimal against those
who consider that infinitesimals had to be eliminated in favour of finite
quantities. Bordas-Demoulin does not absolve the differential calculus of
the accusation of error, but rather considers the differential calculus to
have this error as its principle. According to Bordas-Demoulin, the
minimal error of the infinitesimal 'finds itself compensated by reference
to an error active in the contrary sense. It is in all necessity that the
errors are mutually compensated’ (Bordas-Demoulin 1874, 414; my
translation). The consequence of this mutual compensation 'is that
one differential is only exact after having been combined with another’
(p. 414). Deleuze repeats these arguments of Wronski and Bordas-
Demoulin when he maintains that it is in the differential relation that the
differential is realised as a pure element of quantitability. Each term of
the relation, that is, each differential, each pure element of quantitability,
therefore 'exists absolutely only in its relation to the other' (Deleuze
1994, 172), that is, only insofar as it is reciprocally determined in relation
to another.
The question for Deleuze then becomes: 'in what form is the differential
relation determinable?' (Deleuze 1994, 172) He argues that it is
determinable primarily in qualitative form, insofar as it is the reciprocal
relation between differentials, and then secondarily, insofar as it is the
function of a tangent whose values give the gradient of the line tangent
to a curve, or the specific qualitative nature of this curve, at a point. As
the function of a tangent, the differential relation 'expresses a function
which differs in kind from the so-called primitive function.' (p. 172).
Whereas the primitive function, when differentiated, expresses the whole
curve directly,[^6] the differential relation, when differentiated, expresses
rather the further qualification of the nature of the function at, or in the
immediate neighbourhood of, a specific point. The primitive function is
the integral of the function determined by the inverse transformation of
differentiation, according to the differential calculus. From the differential
point of view of the infinitesimal calculus, the differential relation, as
the function of the tangent, determines the existence and distribution of
the distinctive points of a function, thus preparing for its further qualification.
Unlike the primitive function, the differential relation remains
tied to the specific qualitative nature of the function at those distinctive
points, and, as the function of the tangent, it 'is therefore differentiable in
turn5 (p. 172). When the differential relation is repeatedly differentiated
at a distinctive point generating a power series expansion, what is
increasingly specified is the qualitative nature of the function in the
immediate neighbourhood of that point. Deleuze argues that this convergence
of a power series with an analytic function, in its immediate neighbourhood,
satisfies 'the minimal conditions of an integral5 (p. 174), and
characterises what is for Deleuze the process of 'differentiation.' (p. 209).
The differential relation expresses the qualitative relation between,
not only curves and straight lines, but also between linear dimensions and
their functions, and plane or surface dimensions and their functions. The
domain of the successive adjunction of circles of convergence, as determined
by analytic continuity, actually has the structure of a surface. This
surface is constituted by the points of the domain and the direction
attached to each point in the domain, that is, the tangents to the curve at
each point and the direction of the curve at that point. Such a surface can
be described as a field of directions or a vector field. A vector is a quantity
having both magnitude and direction. The point of departure of the
local genesis of functions is from the point of view of the structure of
such a surface as a vector field. It is within this context that the example
of a jump discontinuity in relation to a finite discontinuous interval
between neighbouring analytic or local functions is developed by
Deleuze, in order to characterise the generation of another function
which extends beyond the points of discontinuity which determine the
limits of these local functions. Such a function would characterise the
relation between the different domains of different local functions. The
genesis of such a function from the local point of view is initially determined
by taking any two points on the surface of a vector field, such that
each point is a pole of a local function determined independently by the
point-wise operations of Weierstrassian analysis. The so-determined
local functions, which have no common distinctive points or poles in the
domain, are discontinuous with each other; each pole being a point of
discontinuity, or limit point, for its respective local function. Rather than
simply being considered as the unchanging limits of local functions
generated by analytic continuity, the limit points of each local function
can be considered in relation to each other, within the context of the
generation of a new function which encompasses the limit points of each
local function and the discontinuity that extends between them. Such a
function can initially be understood to be a potential function, which is
determined as a line of discontinuity between the poles of the two local
functions on the surface of the vector field. The potential function admits
these two points as the poles of its domain. However, the domain of
the potential function is on a scalar field, which is distinct from the
vector field insofar as it is composed of points (scalars) which are nondirectional;
scalar points are the points onto which a vector field is
mapped. The potential function can be defined by the succession of
points (scalars) which stretch between the two poles. The scalar field of
the potential function is distinct from the vector field of the local functions
insofar as, mathematically speaking, it is 'cut’ from the surface of
the vector field. Deleuze argues that ‘the limit must be conceived not as
the limit of a [local] function but as a genuine cut [coupure], a border
between the changeable and the unchangeable within the function itself.
... the limit no longer presupposes the ideas of a continuous variable and
infinite approximation. On the contrary, the concept of limit grounds a
new, static and purely ideal definition’ (Deleuze 1994, 172); that of the
potential function. To cut the surface from one of these poles to the next
is to generate such a potential function. The poles of the potential function
determine the limits of the discontinuous domain, or scalar field;
which is cut from the surface of the vector field. The ‘cut’ of the surface
in this theory renders the structure of the potential function ‘apt to a
creation’ (Lautman 1938a, 8). The precise moment of production, or
genesis, resides in the act by which the cut renders the variables of certain
functional expressions able to ‘jump’ from pole to pole across the
cut. When the variable jumps across this cut, the domain of the potential
function is no longer uniformly discontinuous. With each ‘jump’, the
poles which determine the domain of discontinuity, represented by the
potential function sustained across the cut, seem to have been removed.
The less the cut separates the potential function on the scalar field from
the surface of the vector field, the more the poles seem to have been
removed, and the more the potential function seems to be continuous
with the local functions across the whole surface of the vector field. It is
only insofar as this interpretation is conferred on the structure of the
potential function that a new function can be understood to have been
generated on the surface. A potential function is only generated when
there is potential for the creation of a new function between the poles of
two local functions. The potential function is therefore always apt to the
creation of a new function. This new function, which encompasses the
limit points of each local function and the discontinuity that extends
between them, is continuous across the structure of the potential function;
it completes the structure of the potential function, as what can
be referred to as a ‘composite function’. The connection between the
structural completion of the potential function and the generation of the
corresponding composite function is the act by which the variable jumps
from pole to pole. When the variable jumps across the cut, the value of
the composite function sustains a fixed increase. Although the increase
seems to be sustained by the potential function, it is this increase which
actually registers the generation or complete determination of the
composite function.
The complete determination of a composite function by the
structural completion of the potential function is not determined by
Weierstrass’ theory of analytic continuity. A function is able to be determined
as continuous by analytic continuity across singular points which
are removable, but not across singular points which are non-removable.
The poles that determine the parameters of the domain of the potential
function are non-removable, thus analytic continuity between the two
functions, across the cut, is not able to be established. Weierstrass,
however, recognised a means of solving this problem, by extending his
analysis to meromorphic functions.[^7] A function is said to be meromorphic
in a domain if it is analytic in the domain determined by the poles of
analytic functions. A meromorphic function is determined by the quotient
of two arbitrary analytic functions, which have been determined
independently on the same surface by the point-wise operations of
Weierstrassian analysis. Such a function is defined by the differential
relation:

```
dy   Y
-- = -
dx   X
```

where X and Y are the polynomials, or power series of the two local functions.
The meromorphic function, as the function of a differential relation,
is just the kind of function which can be understood to have been
generated by the structural completion of the potential function. The
meromorphic function is therefore the differential relation of the composite
function. The expansion of the power series determined by the
repeated differentiation of the meromorphic function should generate a
function which converges with a composite function. The graph of a
composite function, however, consists of curves with infinite branches,
because the series generated by the expansion of the meromorphic function
is divergent. The representation of such curves posed a problem for
Weierstrass, which he was unable to resolve, because divergent series fall
outside the parameters of the differential calculus, as determined by the
epsilon-delta approach, since they defy the criterion of convergence.

## The qualitative theory of differential equations.

Henri Poincaré (b.1854 - 1912) took up this problem of the representation
of composite functions, by extending the Weierstrass theory of
meromorphic functions into what was called ‘The qualitative theory of
differential equations’ (Kline 1972, 732). In place of studying the properties
of complex functions in the neighbourhood of their singularities,
Poincaré was primarily occupied with determining the properties of complex
functions in the whole plane, that is, the properties of the entire
curve. This qualitative method involved initial investigation of the geometrical
form of the curves of functions with infinite branches; only then
was numerical determination of the values of the function able to be
made. While such divergent series do not converge, in the Weierstrassian
sense, to a function, they may indeed furnish a useful approximation to a
function if they can be said to represent the function asymptotically.
When such a series is asymptotic to the function, it can represent an analytic
or composite function even though the series is divergent.
When this geometrical interpretation was applied to composite
functions, Poincaré found the values of the composite function around
the singularity produced by the function to be undetermined and irregular.
The singularity of a composite function would be the point at which
both the numerator and denominator of the quotient of the meromorphic
function determinative of the composite function vanish (or equal zero).
The peculiarity of the meromorphic function is that the numerator and
denominator do not vanish at the same point on the surface of the
domain. The points at which the two local functions of the quotient
vanish are at their respective poles. The determination of a composite
function therefore requires the determination of a new singularity in relation
to the poles of the local functions of which it is composed. Poincaré
called this new kind of singularity an essential singularity. Observing that
the values of a composite function very close to an essential singularity
fluctuate through a range of different possibilities without stabilising,
Poincaré distinguished four types of essential singularity, which he classified
according to the behaviour of the function and the geometrical
appearance of the solution curves in the neighbourhood of these points.
The first type of singularity is the saddle point or dip (col), through which
only two solution curves pass, acting as asymptotes for neighbouring
curves. A saddle point is neither a maximum nor minimum, since the
value of the function either increases or decreases depending on the
direction of movement away from it. The second kind of singularity is
the node (noeud), which is a point through which an infinite number of
curves pass. The third type of singularity is the point of focus (foyer),
around which the solution curves turn and towards which they approach
in the same way as logarithmic spirals. And the fourth, called a centre, is
a point around which the curves are closed, concentric with one another
and the centre.
The type of essential singularity is determined by the form of the
constitutive curves of the meromorphic function. Whereas the potential
function remains discontinuous with the other functions on the surface
from which it is cut, thereby representing a discontinuous group of functions,
the composite function, on the contrary, overcomes this discontinuity
insofar as it is continuous in the domain which extends across
the whole surface of the discontinuous group of functions. The existence
of such a continuous function, however, does not express any less the
properties of the domain of discontinuity which serves to define it. The
discontinuous group of local functions and the continuous composite
function attached to this group exist alongside each other, the transformation
from one to the other being determined by the process of the
generation and expansion of the meromorphic function. The potential
function is actualised in the composite function when the variable jumps
from one pole to the other. Its trajectory, in the form of a solution curve,
is determined by the type of essential singularity created by the meromorphic
function. The essential singularity determines the behaviour of
the composite function, or the appearance of the solution curve, in its
immediate neighbourhood by acting as an attractor for the trajectory of
the variable across its domain. It is the value of this function which sustains
a determined increase with each jump of the variable. Insofar as the
trajectory of each variable is attracted to the same final state represented
by each of the different essential singularities, these essential singularities
can be understood to represent what Manuel DeLanda describes as
the ‘inherent or intrinsic long-term tendencies of a system, the states
which the system will spontaneously tend to adopt in the long run as long
as it is not constrained by other forces’ (2002,15).
Deleuze distinguishes this differential point of view of the infinitesimal
calculus from the Weierstrassian theory of approximation when
he writes that: ‘No doubt the specification of the singular points (for
example, dips, nodes, focal points, centres) is undertaken by means of
the form of integral curves, which refer back to the solutions for the
differential equations. There is nevertheless a complete determination
with regard to the existence and distribution of these points which
depends upon a completely different instance - namely, the field of vectors
defined by the equation itself. The complementarity of these two
aspects does not obscure their difference in kind - on the contrary’
(Deleuze 1994,177). The equation to which Deleuze refers is the meromorphic
function, which is a differential equation or function of a differential
relation determined according to the Weierstrassian approach,
from which the essential singularity and therefore the composite function
are determined according to Poincaré’s qualitative approach. This form
of integration is again characterised from the local point of view, by what
Deleuze describes as ‘an original process of différenciation’ (p. 209).
Différenciation is the complete determination of the composite function
from the reciprocally-determined local functions or the structural completion
of the potential function, it is the process whereby a potential
function is actualised as a composite function.
Deleuze states that ‘actualisation or différenciation is always a
genuine creation’, and that to be actualised is ‘to create divergent lines’
(Deleuze 1994,212). The expanded power series of a meromorphic function
is actualised in the composite function insofar as it converges with,
or creates, the divergent lines of the composite function. Différenciation,
therefore, creates an essential singularity, whose divergent lines actualise
the specific qualitative nature of the poles of the group of discontinuous
local functions, represented by a potential function, in the form of a composite
function. These complex functions can be understood to be what
Poincaré called ‘Fuschian functions’, which, as Georges Valiron points
out, ‘are more often called automorphic functions’ (Valiron 1971,171).
The discontinuous group of local functions can therefore also be understood
to be Fuschian groups. Poincaré’s pioneering work in this area
eventually lead to the definitive founding of the geometric theory of analytic
functions, the study of which ‘has not yet been completely carried
out’ (p. 173), but continues to be developed with the assistance of
computers.
Benoit Mandelbrot (b. 1924) considers Poincaré, with his concept
of essential singularities, to be ‘the first student of fractal (‘strange’)
attractors’, that is, of the kinds of attractors operative in fractals which
occur in mathematics, and cites certain theories of Poincaré as having
‘led [him] to new lines of research’, specifically ‘the theory of automorphic
functions’ which made Poincaré and Felix Klein (b. 1849 - 1925)
famous (1982, 414).[^8]
Deleuze does not consider this process of différenciation to be
arrested with the generation of a composite function, but rather it continues,
generating those functions which actualise the relations between
different composite functions, and those functions which actualise the
relations between these functions, and so on. The conception of différenciation
is extended in this way when Deleuze states that There is a
différenciation of différenciation which integrates and welds together the
differenciated’ (Deleuze 1994, 217); each différenciation is simultaneously
‘a local integration’, which then connects with others, according to
the same logic, in what is characterised as a ‘global integration’ (p. 211).
The logic of the differential, as determined according to both differentiation
and différenciation, designates a process of production, or
genesis, which has, for Deleuze, the value of introducing a general theory
of relations which unites the Weierstrassian structural considerations of
the differential calculus with the concept of 'the generation of quantities’
(Deleuze 1994, 175). 'In order to designate the integrity or the integrality
of the object’, when considered as a composite function from the differential
point of view of the infinitesimal calculus, Deleuze argues that,
‘we require the complex concept of different/ciation. The t and the c here
are the distinctive feature or the phonological relation of difference in
person’ (p. 209). Deleuze argues that différenciation is ‘The second part
of difference’ (p. 209), the first being expressed by the logic of the
differential in differentiation. Where the logic of differentiation characterises
a differential philosophy, the complex concept of the logic of
different/ciation characterises Deleuze’s ‘philosophy of difference’
The differential point of view of the infinitesimal calculus represents an
opening, providing a trajectory for the construction of an alternative history
of mathematics; it actually anticipates the return of the infinitesimal
in the differential calculus of contemporary mathematics, thanks to the
axioms of non-standard analysis. This is the interpretation of the differential
calculus to which Deleuze is referring when he appeals to the
‘barbaric or pre-scientific interpretations of the differential calculus’
(Deleuze 1994,171). Deleuze thereby establishes a historical continuity
between the differential point of view of the infinitesimal calculus and
modem theories of the differential calculus which surpasses the methods
of the differential calculus which Weierstrass uses in the epsilon-delta
approach to support the development of a rigorous foundation for the calculus.
While Weierstrass is interested in making advances in mathematics
to secure the development of a rigorous foundation for the differential
calculus, Deleuze is interested in using mathematics to problematise the
reduction of the differential calculus to set theory, by determining an
alternative trajectory in the history of mathematics, one that retrospectively
allows the reintroduction of the infinitesimal into an understanding
of the operation of the calculus. According to Deleuze, the ‘finitist interpretations’
of the calculus given in modern set-theoretical mathematics –
which are congruent with ‘Cantorian finitism’ (Maddy 1988, 488), that
is, ‘the idea that infinite entities are considered to be finite within set
theory’ (Salanskis 1996,66) - betray the nature of the differential no less
than Weierstrass, since they ‘both fail to capture the extra-propositional
or sub-representative source from which calculus draws its power’
(Deleuze 1994, 264). He maintains that ‘the derivative and the integral
have become ordinal rather than quantitative concepts’ (p. 176).
In constructing this theory of relations characteristic of a philosophy
of difference, Deleuze draws significantly from the work of Albert
Lautman, who refers to this whole process as ‘the metaphysics of logic’
(Lautman 1938a, 3). It is in Difference and Repetition that Deleuze formulates
a ‘metaphysics of logic’ that corresponds to the logic of the differential
from the differential point of view of the infinitesimal calculus.
However, he argues that ‘we should speak of a dialectics of the calculus
rather than a metaphysics’ (Deleuze 1994, 178), since ‘each engendered
domain, in which dialectical Ideas of this or that order are incarnated,
possesses its own calculus. It is not mathematics which is applied to
other domains but the dialectic which establishes the direct differential
calculus corresponding or appropriate to the domain under consideration’
(p. 181). Just as he argued that mathematics ‘does not include only
solutions to problems; it also includes the expression of problems relative
to the field of solvability which they define. That is why the differential
calculus belongs to mathematics, even at the very moment when
it finds its sense in the revelation of a dialectic which points beyond
mathematics’ (p. 179). It is in the differential point of view of the infinitesimal
calculus that Deleuze finds a form of the differential calculus
appropriate to the determination of a differential logic. This logic is
deployed by Deleuze, in the form of the logic of different/ciation, in the
development of his project of constructing a philosophy of difference.
The relation between the finite and the infinitesimal is determined
according to what Lautman describes as ‘the logical schemas which
preside over the organisation of their edifices’ (Lautman 1938b, 58).
Lautman argues that ‘it is possible to recover within mathematical
theories, logical Ideas incarnated in the same movement of these
theories’ (p. 58). The logical Ideas to which Lautman refers include the
relations of expression between the finite and the infinitesimal. He argues
that these logical Ideas 'have no other purpose than to contribute to the
illumination of logical schemas within mathematics, which are only
knowable through the mathematics themselves’ (p. 58). The project of
the present essay has been to locate these 'logical Ideas’ in the mathematical
theory of the infinitesimal calculus from the differential point of
view, in order then to determine how Deleuze uses these 'logical Ideas’
to develop the logical schema of a theory of relations characteristic of a
philosophy of difference.
## Notes

[^1]: This essay draws on earlier work that was published in Angelaki 9.3 (2004). See Duffy 2004b.
[^2]: Deleuze acknowledges that ‘the interpretation of the differential calculus has indeed taken the form of asking whether infinitesimals are real or fictive’ (Deleuze 1994, 177). However, for Deleuze, the question is rhetorical, for it is of little importance whether the infinitely small are real, and if they are not this does not signify the contemptible fictive character of their position. What is at stake in the debate on the legitimacy of the infinitesimal is ‘the integration of the infinitesimal into the register of quantity’ (Salanskis 1996, 71), that is, of the infinite in the finite, which comes down to the choice between infinite and finite representations. This problem is taken up in the next section of this essay entitled ‘A new theory of relations’.
[^3]: For a thorough analysis of this problem with limits in Cauchy, see Boyer 1959, 281.
[^4]: Given a function, f(x), having derivatives of all orders, the Taylor series of the function is given by:
    ```
    f(x) = Σ [f^(k)(a) / k!] * (x - a)^k  (from k=0 to ∞)
         = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + [f''(a)/2!](x-a)^2 + ...
    ```
    where f^(k)(a) is the kth derivative of f at a. A function is equal to its Taylor series if and only if its error term Rn can be made arbitrarily small.
[^5]: The Taylor series of a function can be represented in the form of a power series, which is given by:
    ```
    Σ a_n * x^n = a_0 + a_1*x + a_2*x^2 + ... + a_n*x^n + ... (from n=0 to ∞)
    ```
    where each a_n is a distinct constant. It can be shown that any such series either converges at x = 0, or for all real x, or for all x with -R < x < R for some positive real R. The interval (-R, R) is called the circle of convergence, or neighbourhood of the distinctive point. This series should be thought of as a function in x for all x in the circle of convergence. Where defined, this function has derivatives of all orders. See Reinhardt 1985.
[^6]: Deleuze argues that ‘It was a great day for philosophy when ... Leibniz proposed ... that there is no reason for you simply to oppose the singular to the universal. It’s much more interesting if you listen to what mathematicians say, who for their own reasons think of “singular” not in relation to “universal”, but in relation to “ordinary” or “regular”’ (Deleuze 1980). Note: the primitive function ∫f(x)dx, expresses the whole curve f(x).
[^7]: It was Charles A. A. Briot (b. 1817 - 1882) and Jean-Claude Bouquet (b. 1819 - 1885) who introduced the term ‘meromorphic’ for a function which possessed just poles in that domain (Kline 1972, 642).
[^8]: Mandelbrot qualifies these statements when he says of Poincaré that ‘nothing I know of his work makes him even a distant precursor of the fractal geometry of the visible facets of Nature' (1982, 414).
