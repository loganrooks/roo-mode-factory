In 2020, we are celebrating the 250th anniversary of the birth of Hegel.
Is Hegel just a historical curiosity or does his thought still address
us? "Un jour peut-être, le siècle sera Deleuzien," Michel Foucault wrote
decades ago in a review of one of Gilles Deleuze's books. The hypothesis
of the present book is that, if, in some sense, the twentieth century
was not Deleuzian, but Marxian, the twenty-first century will be
Hegelian. This claim cannot but appear as a display of madness -- is, in
our universe of quantum physics and evolutionary biology, of cognitive
sciences and digitalization, of global capitalism and totalitarianism,
Hegel not simply out? Our first point is not that Hegel somehow saw all
this or had a premonition of it -- no, he didn't, and he knew that he
could not. The Hegelian "Absolute Knowing" does not imply that Hegel
"knew it all," it stands precisely for the realization of an
unsurpassable limit. Recall Hegel's emphatic dismissal of "issuing
instructions on how the world ought to be" from the "Preface" of his
[Philosophy of Right]{.class_s1fv}:
:::

::: class_s2m
philosophy, at any rate, always comes too late to perform this function.
As the thought of the world, it appears only at a time when actuality
has gone through its formative process and attained its completed state
... When philosophy paints its grey in grey, a shape of life has grown
old, and it cannot be rejuvenated, but only recognized, by the grey in
grey of philosophy; the owl of Minerva begins its flight only with the
onset of
dusk.[]{#part0005.xhtml#a1P5}[1](#part0014.xhtml#a1UH){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
Robert Pippin noted the obvious (although rarely drawn) implication of
this claim: it has to apply also to the notion of State
[]{#part0005.xhtml#page_2}deployed in his own [Philosophy of
Right]{.class_s1fv} -- the fact that Hegel was able to deploy its
concept means that dusk is falling on what readers of Hegel usually
perceive as a normative description of a model rational state. That's
why Hegel's thought stands for a radical opening towards the future:
there is in Hegel no eschatology, no image of the bright (or dark)
future towards which our epoch tends. It may appear no less obvious
that, for this same reason, Hegel is the worst possible choice for a
thinker through whose lens one should read our present -- yes, he was
totally open towards the future, but was he not for this very reason
unable to cast any light on it?
:::

::: class_s2s
Our wager is here the exact opposite of this "obvious" platitude:
precisely as totally "out of date," Hegel's thought provides unique
lenses to perceive the prospects and threats of our time. To be a
Hegelian today does not mean to construct a new ideal (of full
recognition, of rational state, of scientific knowing), and then analyze
how and why we are not yet there and how to get there. What it means is
to act as a true post-Hegelian: to take Hegel not as a conclusion but as
a starting point and ask: how would our present state of things appear
from this starting point? Again, what if Hegel allows us as a better
(proper) understanding of precisely those phenomena which are distinctly
post-Hegelian, which stand for what "Hegel couldn't imagine"?

:::

::: class_s2j
But which Hegel am I referring to here? Where am I speaking
from?[]{#part0005.xhtml#a1RU}[2](#part0014.xhtml#a1US){.class_s1fz} To
simplify it to the utmost, the triad that defines my philosophical
stance is that of Spinoza, Kant and Hegel. Spinoza is arguably the
pinnacle of realist ontology: there is substantial reality out there,
and we can get to know it through our reason, dispelling the veil of
illusions. Kant's transcendental turn introduces a radical gap here: we
cannot ever gain access to the way things are in themselves, our reason
is constricted to the domain of phenomena, and if we try to reach beyond
phenomena to the totality of being, our mind gets caught in necessary
antinomies and inconsistencies. What Hegel does here is to posit that
there is no reality in-itself []{#part0005.xhtml#page_3}beyond
phenomena, which does not mean that all that there is is the interplay
of phenomena. The phenomenal world is marked by the bar of
impossibility, but beyond this bar there is nothing, no other world, no
positive reality, so we are not returning to pre-Kantian realism; it is
just that what for Kant is the limitation of our knowledge, the
impossibility to reach the thing-in-itself, is inscribed into this thing
itself.
:::

::: class_s2s
But, again, can Hegel still play this role of the unsurpassable horizon
of our thinking? Does the true rupture with traditional metaphysical
universe, the rupture which defines the coordinates of our thinking, not
take place later? The safest indication of this rupture is our gut
feeling that overwhelms us when we read some classical metaphysical text
-- something tells us that today, we simply cannot any longer think like
that ... And does such a gut feeling also not overwhelm us when we read
Hegel's speculations about the absolute Idea, etc.? There are a couple
of candidates for this rupture which makes Hegel no longer our
contemporary, beginning with the post-Hegelian turn of Schelling,
Kierkegaard and Marx, but this turn can be easily accounted for in the
terms of an immanent reversal of the German Idealist topic. With regard
to philosophical issues that predominated in the last decades, a new and
more convincing case for this rupture was made by Paul Livingston who,
in his [The Politics of
Logic]{.class_s1fv},[]{#part0005.xhtml#a1V5}[3](#part0014.xhtml#a1GV){.class_s1fz}
located it in the new space symbolized by the names "Cantor" and
"Goedel," where, of course, "Cantor" stands for set theory, through
self-relating procedures (empty set, set of sets), and compels us to
admit an infinity of infinities, and "Goedel" for his two incompleteness
theorems which demonstrate that -- to simplify it to the utmost -- an
axiomatic system cannot demonstrate its own consistency since it
necessarily generates statements which can neither be proved nor
disproved by it.
:::

::: class_s2s
With this rupture, we enter a new universe which compels us to leave
behind the notion of a consistent view of (all of) reality. (Even
Marxism, at least in its predominant form, can still be viewed as a mode
of thinking that belongs in the old universe: it elaborates a quite
consistent view of social totality, in some versions even of the all of
reality.) However, the new universe has nothing whatsoever to do with
the irrationalism of [Lebensphilosphie]{.class_s1fv} whose first
[]{#part0005.xhtml#page_4}representative was Schopenhauer, i.e., with
the idea that our rational mind is just a thin surface and that the true
bases of reality are irrational drives. We remain within the domain of
reason, and this domain is deprived of its consistency from within:
immanent inconsistencies of reason do not imply that there is some
deeper reality which escapes reason; these inconsistencies are in some
sense "the thing itself." We thus find ourselves in a universe in which
inconsistencies are not a sign of our epistemological confusion, of the
fact that we missed "the thing itself" (which by definition cannot be
inconsistent), but, on the contrary, a sign that we have touched the
real.
:::

::: class_s2s
The roots of all these inconsistencies are, of course, the paradoxes of
self-relating, of a set becoming one of its own elements, of a set
including an empty set as one of its sub-sets, as its own stand-in among
its sub-sets. The Hegelo-Lacanian perspective conceives these paradoxes
as an indication of the presence of subjectivity: subject can emerge
only in the imbalance between a genus and its species, the void of
subjectivity is ultimately the empty set as the species in which a genus
encounters itself in its oppositional determination, as Hegel would have
put it. But how can the same feature be the sign of subjectivity and
simultaneously the sign that we touched the real? Do we not touch the
real precisely when we succeed in erasing our subjective standpoint and
perceive things "the way they really are," independently of our
subjective standpoint? The lesson of both Hegel and Lacan is exactly the
opposite: every vision of "objective reality" is already constituted
through (transcendental) subjectivity, and we only touch the real when
we include in the scope of our vision the cut-in-the-real of
subjectivity itself.
:::

::: class_s2s
The metaphysics of subjectivity deals with these paradoxes by means of
the notion of reflexivity as the basic feature of self-consciousness, of
our mind's ability to relate to itself, to be aware not only of objects
but also of itself, of how it relates to objects. The elementary gesture
of reflexivity is that of taking a step back and including in the
picture or situation one is observing or analyzing one's own presence --
only in this way can one get the full picture. When, in a detective
novel, the investigator is analyzing the scene of the crime, he has to
include in it his own presence, his own []{#part0005.xhtml#page_5}gaze
-- sometimes, the crime is literally staged for him, to attract his
gaze, to involve him in the story. (In some movies, the detective who
investigates a murder discovers that he is directly its addressee, i.e.,
that the murderer intended the crime as a warning to him.) Similarly, in
one of the Perry Mason novels, Mason witnesses the police interrogation
of a couple suspected of murder and cannot understand why the husband
more than willingly narrates all the details of what the couple was
doing on the day of the murder, but then he gets it -- the true
addressee of the husband's detailed report was his wife, i.e., he used
the opportunity of being together (the two were kept separated in the
prison) to tell her their false alibi, the lie they should both stick to
... One can also imagine a story in which the story the suspected
murderer tells the police is a veiled blackmailing threat to one of the
police detectives present. What all these cases share is the fact that
to understand a statement, one has to identify its addressee. That's why
a detective needs a figure like Holmes's Watson or Poirot's Hastings,
somebody who stands for the big Other in its aspect of the common sense,
the gaze the murderer had in view when he committed the crime.
:::

::: class_s2s
What becomes palpable with Cantor/Goedel's rupture is the full extent of
self-referential paradoxes that pertain to subjectivity: once we include
our own position in the picture of the all, there is no way back to a
consistent worldview. The Cantor/Goedel rupture thus renders impossible
a consistent totality. We have to choose between totality and
consistency, we cannot have both at the same time, and this choice is
actualized in the two orientations of the twentieth-century thought
baptized by Livingston: generic (Badiou's stance of opting for
consistency at the expense of totality) and paradoxico-critical (opting
for totality at the expense of consistency -- into this pot, Livingston
not quite convincingly throws Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Levi-Strauss,
Foucault, Deleuze, Derrida, Agamben and Lacan). At this point we notice
the first strange fact in Livingston's edifice, a surprising imbalance:
although paradoxico-critical and generic are presented as two ways to
deal with the new universe which renders consistent totality impossible,
we get on the one side a multiplicity of very divergent thinkers and on
the other one name alone, Badiou. The implication of this imbalance is
clear: it demonstrates that the true topic of Livingston's
[]{#part0005.xhtml#page_6}book is how to provide a proper
paradoxico-critical answer to Badiou's generic approach? Livingston
treats Badiou with great respect and is well aware that the logical and
political foundations of his generic position are elaborated in a much
more precise manner than the respective positions of the main
representatives of the paradoxico-critical approach. What makes Badiou
so important is that he explicitly elaborates his position on the topic
indicated by the title of Livingston's book, "the politics of logic":
the profound political implications of the philosophico-logical topic of
consistency, totality, and the paradoxes of self-reference. Do such
paradoxes not lie at the very heart of every power edifice which has to
impose itself in an illegitimate way and then retroactively legitimize
its exercise of power?
:::

::: class_s2s
While I deeply appreciate Livingston's approach, my differences with him
are multiple. First, the basic duality of the universe of thought that
precedes the Cantor/Goedel rupture is for me not that between
ontotheological and criteriological, but that between ontological (in
the sense of realist universal ontology) and transcendental -- between
Spinoza and Kant, to give two exemplary names. Second, the true rupture
with this universe is enacted already by Hegel, and post-Hegelian
thought is a regression with regard to Hegel. Livingston's stance
towards Hegel is clear: while he admits that Hegel's dialectics is an
exemplary case of inconsistent totality, he claims that, nonetheless, in
Hegel's thought this inconsistency is ultimately "sublated" in a larger
totality of rational self-development, so that antagonisms and
contradictions are reduced to subordinated moments of the One. Although
this view may appear almost self-evident, one should nonetheless
question it. Hegel differs from the paradoxico-critical stance not
because in his thought all antagonisms and contradictions are "sublated"
in the One of the dialectical totality -- the difference is much more
subtle.
:::

::: class_s2s
To explain this difference, let's make a detour through Lacan. For a
Lacanian, it is immediately evident that Livingston's duality of generic
and paradoxico-critical perfectly fits the duality of the masculine side
and the feminine side of the "formulas of sexuation." Badiou's generic
position is clearly "masculine": we have the universal order of being
(whose ontological structure is described in detail in Badiou's work),
and the exception of truth-events which []{#part0005.xhtml#page_7}can
happen occasionally. The order of being is consistent and continuous,
obeying strict ontological rules, allowing no self-referential
paradoxes; it is a universe with no pre-established unity, a universe
composed of multitudes of multitudes, of many worlds and many languages.
Badiou provides here a great lesson against the traditional wisdom
according to which life is a circular movement and ultimately everything
returns to
dust:[]{#part0005.xhtml#a1JX}[4](#part0014.xhtml#a1HU){.class_s1fz} this
closed circle of reality, of its generation and corruption, is not all
there is; miracles happen from time to time, the circular movement of
life is suspended by the irruption of something that traditional
metaphysics and theology called eternity, a moment of stasis in the
double sense of the term (fixation, freezing of the movement of life,
and simultaneously disturbance, unrest, the rise of something that
resists the regular flow of things). Think about falling in love: it is
a radical disturbance of my life as usual, and my life gets frozen by
the fixation on the beloved ... In contrast to this logic of universal
order of Being and its eventual exception, the paradoxico-critical
approach focuses on the immanent inconsistencies and disturbances of the
order of Being itself. There is no exception to Being -- not because the
order of Being is all there is but because, to put it in speculative
terms, paradoxico-critical analysis demonstrates how [this order is
already in itself its own exception]{.class_s1fv}, sustained by
permanent violations of its own rules. Although Badiou describes in
precise terms how the voids and gaps (between presence and
representation) in the order of Being render an Event possible, he
nonetheless defines the Event as a miraculous intrusion which disturbs
the continuity of Being, as something that is not part of
Being.[]{#part0005.xhtml#a1R7}[5](#part0014.xhtml#a1HV){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2s
From the paradoxico-critical standpoint, however, the order of Being is
constitutively pulverized and disturbed from within -- in Freudian
terms, and insofar as Badiou constantly refers to the order of human
Being as the survivalist search for pleasures, one could say that Badiou
neglects the dimension of what Freud called the "death drive," the
disruptive force of non-being in the heart of Being. In this way, we
pass from the "masculine" to the "feminine" logic: instead of the
universal order of Being disturbed by eventual exceptions, Being itself
is branded by a basic impossibility, not-all.
:::

::: {#part0005.xhtml#page_8 .class_s2s}
Livingston perspicuously notices the price Badiou has to pay for his
universal and consistent mathematical ontology: he has to posit as the
basic constituents of reality multitude and void, "multitudes of
multitudes" that emerge out of the void and not through the
self-differentiation of the One. In the Cantor-Goedel universe, one can
get a consistent universality only if the One is excluded from it at the
most basic level -- One emerges in a second time, as the result of the
operation of counting that constitutes out of the multitude a world. At
this level, we also have an irreducible multiplicity of worlds --
bodies, worlds, languages, they are all multiple, impossible to totalize
under some One. The only true universality, the only universality able
to impose a One which traverses the multiplicity of bodies and languages
(and also of "worlds") is the universality of an Event. In politics, at
the level of Being there is just a multiplicity of bodies and languages,
or of "worlds" (cultures), so all we can get at this level is some kind
of liberal multiculturalism and tolerance for irreducible difference,
every project of imposing a universal Project that would unite all
culture -- like Communism -- has to appear as an oppressive violent
imposition. In contrast to Badiou's generic approach, the
paradoxico-critical approach does not accept the ontological priority of
the multiple over the One: of course every One is undermined, failed,
fractured by antagonisms and inconsistencies, but it is here from the
beginning as the impossibility which opens up the space for
multiplicity. With regard to language, the Bible is right with its
parable of the tower of Babylon: the multiplicity of languages
presupposes the failure of the One Language. This is what Hegel aims at
by his notion of "concrete universality": the enchainment of failures.
Multiple forms of state arise because state is in itself an
inconsistent/antagonist notion.
:::

::: class_s2s
To put it in a different way, the elementary move of concrete
universality is to turn the exception to a universality into the element
that grounds this universality itself. Let's take a perhaps surprising
case, that of the Jews and the State of Israel. Alain Finkielkraut
wrote: "The Jews, they have today chosen the path of
rooting."[]{#part0005.xhtml#a1W9}[6](#part0014.xhtml#a1V1){.class_s1fz}
It is easy to discern in this claim an echo of Heidegger who, in his
[Spiegel]{.class_s1fv} interview, asserts that all essential and great
things can only emerge from our having a homeland, from being rooted in
a tradition. The irony is that we are dealing here with a
[]{#part0005.xhtml#page_9}weird attempt to mobilize anti-Semitic clichés
in order to legitimize Zionism: anti-Semitism reproaches the Jews for
being rootless, and it is as if Zionism tries to correct this failure by
belatedly providing Jews with roots ... No wonder many conservative
anti-Semites ferociously support the expansion of the State of Israel.
However, the trouble with Jews today is that they are now trying to get
roots in a place which for thousands of years was not theirs but
inhabited by other people. The solution is here not to re-normalize the
Jews into yet another rooted nation, but to turn the perspective around:
what if Jews as the exception are a true stand-in for universality,
i.e., what if, at the most radical level, "we are all Jews," what if
being-rootless is the primordial state of being-human, and our roots are
a secondary phenomenon, an attempt to obfuscate our constitutive
rootlessness?
:::

::: class_s2s
But Hegel here takes a step further from what Livingston describes as
the paradoxico-critical stance: for Hegel, the One of self-identity is
not just always inconsistent, fractured, antagonistic, etc. -- identity
itself is the assertion of radical (self-)difference: to say that
something is identical with itself means that it is distinct from all
its particular properties, that it cannot be reduced to them. "A rose is
a rose" means that a rose is something more than all its features --
there is some [je ne sais quoi]{.class_s1fv} which makes it a rose,
something "more in a rose than the rose itself." As this last example
indicates, we are also dealing here with what Lacan called [objet petit
a]{.class_s1fv}, the mysterious X beneath all its properties that makes
an object what it is, that sustains its unique identity. More precisely,
this "more" oscillates between the sublime and the ridiculous or vulgar,
obscene even: to say "a law is a law" means that, even if it is unjust
and arbitrary, an instrument of corruption even, a law remains a law and
has to be respected. The minimal structure of identity (which is always
self-identity since it is, as Hegel knew it, a category of reflection)
is thus 1-1-a: a thing is itself in contrast with its determinate
properties, and [objet a]{.class_s1fv} is the unfathomable excess that
sustains this identity.
:::

::: class_s2s
This, finally, brings us to the subtle difference between Hegel and the
paradoxico-critical approach: it is not that Hegel subordinates
inconsistencies and antagonisms to some higher unity; it is, on the
contrary, that for Hegel identity, the unity of the One, is a form of
[]{#part0005.xhtml#page_10}self-differentiation. Identity is difference
brought to the extreme of self-relating. The unity of the One is not
permanently threatened by cracks and inconsistencies, the unity of the
One is the crack as such. What this means is that the Hegelian totality
is paradoxical, inconsistent, but not "critical" in the sense of
resisting the power center; it is not caught in the eternal struggle to
undermine or displace the power center, in search of cracks and
"undecidable" excesses that disturb and deconstruct the power edifice.
Or, to put it in the Hegelian terms of speculative identity, power is
its own transgression, grounded in violations of its own founding
principles. Although the paradoxico-critical approach brings out the
inconsistencies that are constitutive of our identities, its critical
stance commits it to the goal of overcoming these inconsistencies; this
goal is, of course, out of reach, forever missed and postponed, which is
why the paradoxico-critical approach perceives itself as an endless
process. Derrida, the ultimate paradoxico-critical thinker, likes to
talk about deconstruction as an infinite pursuit of justice, and, in
politics, about "democracy to come" (never already-here).
:::

::: class_s2s
In clear contrast to this stance, Hegel is [not]{.class_s1fv} a critical
thinker: his basic stance is that of reconciliation -- not
reconciliation as a long-term goal but reconciliation as a fact which
confronts us with the unexpected bitter truth of the actualized Ideal.
If there is a Hegelian motto, it is something like: find a truth in how
things go wrong! The message of Hegel is not "the spirit of trust" (the
title of Brandom's latest book on Hegel's [Phenomenology]{.class_s1fv}),
but rather the spirit of distrust -- his premise is that every large
human project goes wrong and only in this way attests to its truth. The
French Revolution wanted universal freedom and climaxed in terror,
Communism wanted global emancipation and gave birth to Stalinist terror
... Hegel's lesson is thus a new version of Big Brother's famous slogan
from Orwell's [1984]{.class_s1fv} "freedom is slavery": when we try to
enforce freedom directly, the result is slavery. So whatever Hegel is,
he is decidedly not a thinker of a perfect ideal that we approach
infinitely. Heinrich Heine (who was Hegel's student in the philosopher's
last years) propagated the story that he once told Hegel he could not
endorse Hegel's formula "all that is actual is rational," and that Hegel
looked carefully around and told his student not too loudly: "Perhaps, I
should say: all that is actual [should be]{.class_s1fv} rational." Even
if []{#part0005.xhtml#page_11}factually true, this anecdote is
philosophically a lie -- if not an outright invention of Heine; it
represents Hegel's attempt to cover up from his student the painful
truth of his thinking.
:::

::: class_s2s
Renouncing a critical stance does not imply renouncing social change, it
just raises the stakes of this change. Let's take the touchy case of
receiving immigrants. Pia Klemp, captain of the ship
[Iuventa]{.class_s1fv} which was saving refugees in the Mediterranean,
concluded her explanation as to why she decided to refuse the Grand
Vermeil medal awarded to her by the city of Paris with the slogan:
"Documents and housing for all! Freedom of movement and
residence!"[]{#part0005.xhtml#a1GE}[7](#part0014.xhtml#a1N9){.class_s1fz}
If this means that -- to cut a long story short -- every individual has
the right to move to a country of his/her choice, and that this country
has the duty to provide him/her with residence, then we are dealing here
with an abstract vision in the strict Hegelian sense: a vision which
ignores the complex context of social totality. The problem cannot be
solved at this level: the only true solution is to change the global
economic system which produces immigrants. The task is thus to take a
step back from direct criticism to the analysis of the immanent
antagonism of the criticized phenomenon, with the focus on how our
critical position itself participates in the phenomenon it criticizes.
:::

::: class_s2s
The Hegelian lesson with regard to the attempt to change the world is
thus desperately optimistic: such attempts never reach their goal, but
through their repeated failure a new form of being can arise. Yes,
Chavismo failed in Venezuela, Syriza failed in Greece, Chinese Communism
cannot be our ideal, but all these processes do contribute to the
subterranean weaving of the Spirit which might give birth to
unpredictable new visions ... or horrors.

[... to a Wired Brain](#part0004.xhtml#a1V9){.calibre2}
:::

::: class_s2j
And this brings us to the topic of the present book. It is our premise
that Hegel's outline of an inconsistent totality is the ultimate stand
of thinking, and we should also not be afraid to apply to it Hegel's
above-quoted claim that philosophy can only paint "grey on grey," that
it can only grasp the notional truth of an epoch when this epoch is
approaching its end. The fact that Hegel's thought is
[]{#part0005.xhtml#page_12}re-emerging today as the ultimate form of the
Cantor-Goedel universe means that there is on the horizon a new
historical form which poses a threat to it. It is our further premise
that the prospect of a wired brain (a direct link between our brain and
a digital machine, what is popularly called "neuralink") is the main
indication of this threat, so the question is: what will happen with the
human spirit, with our subjectivity, if something like the wired brain
will effectively emerge? Perhaps, what will elude the digital space is
not the complexity of thinking but the most elementary self-identity of
a thing, the simple "A is A" which works only in a symbolic space ...
:::

::: class_s2s
This book is therefore not a study of Hegel. What it tries to practice
is a Hegelian approach. Its premise is that Hegel is alive as a thinker
only if his approach still works, i.e., only if the question "how does
our time look in the eyes of Hegel?" remains meaningful and productive.
And can one imagine a more stern test of the continuing productivity of
the Hegelian approach than the phenomenon of the wired brain which is a
post-Hegelian phenomenon [par excellence]{.class_s1fv}, something
totally unthinkable for Hegel, something that clearly belongs to a
different era?
:::

::: class_s2s
To practice a Hegelian approach means a couple of things. First, this
book offers a philosophical analysis of the notion of the wired brain
and its ideological extrapolation, the notion of Singularity. It does
not deal with the vast empirical domains of technology, economics,
politics, sexuality or art, i.e., it does not provide a close analysis
of specific phenomena such as the implications of the wired brain for
the technology of medicine, markets, computing algorithms, and it
ignores specific topics like the implications of the wired brain for
transsexuality. It focuses on one and only one key question: how will
the phenomenon of a wired brain affect not only our self-experience of
free human individuals, but also our very status of free human
individuals? This question will also compel us to clarify the notion of
being-human itself: if we are effectively entering a post-human era, how
does this fact allow us to perceive in a new way the essence of
being-human? As a rule, we can only perceive the essential dimension of
a certain phenomenon when its very existence is threatened, in the same
way we can only experience the spiritual weight of a person when he or
she unexpectedly dies. My focus on this key question is easily
discernible by its obsessive []{#part0005.xhtml#page_13}repetition in
almost every chapter of the book, as if I am desperately trying to
unravel an unresolvable enigma.
:::

::: class_s2s
Second, the Hegelian approach means that it would be meaningless to try
to define in advance the notions of the wired brain and of Singularity,
since it is the very task of this book to elaborate them. All that we
can do here is to demarcate them in a purely formal way. "Wired brain"
refers to a direct link between our mental processes and a digital
machine, a link which, while it enables me to directly trigger events in
reality with a mere thought (I think about something like starting my
air conditioner, the computer deciphers my thought and triggers the air
conditioner), it also enables the digital machine to control my
thoughts. "Singularity" refers to the idea that, by way of directly
sharing my thoughts and experiences with others (a machine which reads
my mental processes can also transpose it to another mind), a domain of
global shared mental experience will emerge which will function as a new
form of divinity -- my thoughts will be directly immersed in a global
Thought of the universe itself.
:::

::: class_s2s
One should note that we will also leave aside the problem of the
technological feasibility of a wired brain (can it really be done the
way post-humanists plan to do it?). Among numerous reports, let us just
mention AlterEgo, "a wearable silent speech output--input device
developed by MIT Media Lab. The device is attached around the head,
neck, and jawline and translates your brain speech center impulse input
into words on a computer, without
vocalization."[]{#part0005.xhtml#a1J6}[8](#part0014.xhtml#a1N4){.class_s1fz}
Arnav Kapur (who developed the system) points out that "it's not just
reading your thoughts; you have to consciously decide to use it":
:::

::: class_s2m
The small headset is able to detect, via powerful sensors, the signals
the brain sends to internal speech mechanisms, like the tongue or
larynx, when you speak to yourself. Imagine asking yourself a question,
but not actually saying the words aloud. Even if you don't move your
lips or your face, your internal speech system is still doing the work
of forming that sentence. Your internal speech muscles like your tongue
are vibrating in accordance with the words you're thinking in ways that
are very subtle and [almost]{.class_s1fv}
undetectable.[]{#part0005.xhtml#a1RW}[9](#part0014.xhtml#a1HP){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: {#part0005.xhtml#page_14 .class_s2p}
For the time being, I thus have to will it since the machine does not
read my mind but my internal speech muscles which move only when I have
the intention to speak. At this level, lying is still possible: I just
simply imagine wanting to say something that is not true, my speech
muscles will move accordingly and the machine will "read" this deceitful
speech intention of mine as a fact ... However, one can easily imagine
the step further making it possible for the machine to follow my line of
thought without my consent or even my awareness of it -- a clear
dystopian prospect.
:::

::: class_s2s
But do we really live in a dystopian time or do we rather live in a time
of dystopian fantasies? Is the idea of a wired brain itself, with its
vision of collective sharing of intimate experiences, not a fantasy, a
fantasmatic extrapolation of trends which cannot be realized the way
they are conceived? One thing is for sure: we should not underestimate
the shattering impact of collectively shared experience -- even if it
will be realized in a much more modest way than today's grandiose
visions of Singularity, everything will change with it. The sceptics'
view was best encapsulated in a recent debate in Seoul where an old
gentleman (whose name escapes me) proposed a wonderful paradox: not only
will Singularity not be as bad as predicted (we, humans, will retain our
spirituality with all its ambiguities, beliefs without beliefs,
references to absentials, etc.), but it also cannot happen. While
agreeing that it cannot happen the way it is described by its
proponents, we should nonetheless insist that something new and
unpredictable will happen. Peter
Sloterdijk[]{#part0005.xhtml#a1SY}[10](#part0014.xhtml#a1K5){.class_s1fz}
was right to characterize Ray Kurzweil as a new John the Baptist, a
forerunner of a new form of post-humanity: Kurzweil perfectly captured
the radical implications of a wired brain; he saw clearly that our
entire vision of reality and our role in it will change.
:::

::: class_s2s
More than the idea of a wired brain, Kurzweil's notion of Singularity
relies on the prospect of artificial intelligence (AI): he predicts
that, due to the exponential growth of the capacity of digital machines,
we will soon be dealing with machines which will not only display all
the signs of self-awareness but also far surpass human intelligence. We
should not confuse this "posthuman" stance with the paradigmatically
modern belief in the possibility of total technological domination over
nature -- what we are witnessing today is an exemplary dialectical
reversal: the slogan of today's []{#part0005.xhtml#page_15}"posthuman"
sciences is no longer domination, but surprise (contingent, nonplanned)
emergence. Jean-Pierre Dupuy detected a weird reversal of the
traditional Cartesian anthropocentric arrogance which grounded human
technology, the reversal clearly discernible in today's robotics,
genetics, nanotechnology, artificial life and AI researches:
:::

::: class_s2m
how are we to explain that science became such a "risky" activity that,
according to some top scientists, it poses today the principal threat to
the survival of humanity? Some philosophers reply to this question by
saying that Descartes's dream -- "to become master and possessor of
nature" -- has turned wrong, and that we should urgently return to the
"mastery of mastery". They have understood nothing. They don't see that
the technology profiling itself at our horizon through "convergence" of
all disciplines aims precisely at nonmastery. The engineer of tomorrow
will not be a sorcerer's apprentice because of his negligence or
ignorance, but by choice. He will "give" himself complex structures or
organizations and he will try to learn what they are capable of by way
of exploring their functional properties -- an ascending, bottom-up
approach. He will be an explorer and experimenter at least as much as an
executor. The measure of his success will be more the extent to which
his own creations will surprise him than the conformity of his
realization to the list of preestablished
tasks.[]{#part0005.xhtml#a1TP}[11](#part0014.xhtml#a1JW){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
Is this weird tendency to actualize self-annihilation not a clear and
unexpected form of what Freud called the death-drive? The motor of this
self-surpassing of humans is the ongoing scientific progress in
evolutionary biology, neurology, and cognitivist brain sciences which is
sustained by a weird form of shame: the shame about our biological
limitations, our mortality, the ridiculous way we reproduce ourselves --
what Gunther Anders called the "Promethean
shame,"[]{#part0005.xhtml#a1WJ}[12](#part0014.xhtml#a1TF){.class_s1fz}
ultimately simply the shame that "we were born and not manufactured."
Nietzsche's idea that we are the "last men" laying the ground for our
own extinction and the arrival of a new Overman is thereby given a
scientific-technological twist ... However, due to our limitations we
shall ignore in this book the topic of AI. Although AI and the wired
brain are obviously interlinked, they []{#part0005.xhtml#page_16}are
clearly distinct: AI can surpass us, humans, without drawing us into the
space of shared experience, i.e., leaving our miserable brains to
function the way they always have until now.
:::

::: class_s2s
We therefore presume that, in spite of all simplifications and
exaggerations in the public media, something is going on in this domain,
and we will limit ourselves to questioning its philosophical
implications and consequences. This is why the vision of Singularity is
worth addressing: in spite of the overload of New Age obscurantism mixed
with techno-naivety, we should paraphrase Groucho Marx and say: "They
claim to present something really New, and they act like they present
something really New, but this shouldn't deceive you -- they do point
towards the emergence of something really New!" At this early stage of
development, we can only speculate how the immersion in Singularity as
the space of shared thoughts and experiences will be organized: how will
the subject and/or the machine decide to get connected (or
disconnected)? How will the scope of connection be decided? (How much of
the machine's knowledge will be accessible to me? In what way and with
whom will I share experiences?) We should just bear in mind that all
these are also questions of utmost political
importance.[]{#part0005.xhtml#a1J2}[13](#part0014.xhtml#a1UV){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2s
The point is thus not to criticize the ideas on human mind and language
presupposed by Musk, Kurzweil and other proponents of the wired brain as
naïve and primitive -- of course they combine a common-sense notion of
ego with vulgar naturalism, but the point is that these ideas can become
reality insofar as they will be embodied in digital machines which will
scan and treat our brains. Even when Musk and others talk about how the
wired brain can threaten our humanity, they conceive this threatened
dimension, the essence of our being-human, in a very narrow and
misleading way. So, perhaps, the true threat to our being-human resides
in the very narrow and misleading notion of being-human that Musk,
Kurzweil and others automatically assume in their description of what is
threatened by the wired brain. When we talk about post-humanity, we
should always be attentive to how we understand humanity itself.
Perhaps, the prospect of post-humanity will enable us precisely to gain
a new insight into what being-human
means.[]{#part0005.xhtml#a1HJ}[14](#part0014.xhtml#a1ME){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2s
Three dimensions are therefore inextricably interlocked in our project:
theoretical, experiential, and institutional. We oscillate all
[]{#part0005.xhtml#page_17}the time between these three dimensions: (1)
inquiry into the structure of a wired brain, what its theoretical
implications will be; (2) what it will mean for individuals to have
their brains wired, how it will transform their (self-)experience; (3)
and, last but not least, what will be the socio-political institutional
implications of wired brains, what kind of new power relations wired
brains will give birth to, how the vast digital network sustaining it
will be organized and regulated? Military institutions are reacting to
this threat in a predictable way: "Wanted: military 'ethicist'. Skills:
data crunching, machine learning, killer robots. Must have: cool head,
moral compass and the will to say no to generals, scientists and even
presidents. The Pentagon is looking for the right person to help it
navigate the morally murky waters of artificial intelligence (AI),
billed as the battlefield of the 21st
century."[]{#part0005.xhtml#a1S7}[15](#part0014.xhtml#a1H4){.class_s1fz}
A pseudo-solution in the vein of different ethical committees meant to
limit the "misuses" of science, of course: what is needed is the public
transparency of such projects.
:::

::: class_s2s
A well-informed observer cannot help but note that these same three
dimensions are constitutive of every ideology -- let's take religion: a
religion is (1) a system of beliefs elaborated by theology that contains
answers to "big" questions about the ultimate nature of reality; (2) a
complex network of intimate experiences of the divine dimension; and (3)
an ideological apparatus, a set of institutions and material practices
(rituals, etc.). And the same goes for psychoanalysis which is a theory
(not only) about the human psyche, a clinical practice, and (we should
never forget) an "organized crowd," a therapeutic institution with its
rules of
identification.[]{#part0005.xhtml#a1TB}[16](#part0014.xhtml#a1HK){.class_s1fz}
Back to Singularity, it comprises the same three dimensions: it offers a
new account of humanity and its passage into post-humanity, even with a
new theological dimension; it promises a new subjective experience of
being immersed in a space of collective mind; but -- the aspect that is
regularly neglected -- Singularity will also imply a vast network of
machines embedded in our social relations of domination. Will we simply
be controlled by machines? Will a part of humanity retail a privileged
contact with them? To put it in brutally simplified terms: how will the
(eventual) rise of Singularity affect capitalism and forms of social
power?
:::

::: class_s2s
One should therefore submit the idea of a wired brain to a critical
analysis that works at three different levels. First (but this is
[]{#part0005.xhtml#page_18}outside the scope of this book), we should
question its technological feasibility: can we really construct machines
that will directly interact with the neuronal flow that provides the
immediate material base of our self-awareness? Second, even if we
somehow succeed in wiring our brain, will this really enable a direct
sharing of other people's experiences? What about the externalist view
according to which our meaningful experiences are not like inner images
located somewhere in our brain but "out of brain," something that occurs
as the result of the complex interaction between our brain, our bodily
activities, and the complex reality in which we interact, so that
focusing on our isolated brain by definition misses the targeted
experience? Third, even if sharing experiences will somehow work, will
our subjectivity survive this immersion in a common space? To give a
hint at our final result, what eludes Singularity is not my lived
experience but our unconscious correlated with the autonomy of the
Cartesian subject.
:::

::: {#part0005.xhtml#a194 .heading_s2u}
[Parataxis](#part0004.xhtml#a1RY){.calibre2}
:::

::: class_s2j
One last caveat: a Hegelian approach that focuses on basic notions does
not involve a systematic conceptual analysis which ignores particular
content. If one reads Hegel closely, one quickly realizes that Hegel
really proceeds in a paratactic way, moving in often violent jumps from
one to another particular content -- and this book is also a paratactic
presentation of its topic. Parataxis (Greek [παράταξις]{.class_s1hr},
the "act of placing side by side") is a literary technique which favors
short, simple sentences, with the use of coordinating rather than
subordinating conjunctions. In poetic parataxis, two images or fragments
-- usually starkly dissimilar images or fragments -- are juxtaposed
without a clear connection, so that readers are left to make their own
connections implied by the paratactic syntax ... So in some sense, the
reproach that this book is neither about Hegel nor about the wired brain
hits the mark -- it hits the mark, but it misses the point which is
precisely to circulate in a paratactic mode around its two nodal points.
Is such a procedure not utterly foreign to Hegel's systematic approach?
No -- can one imagine a more paratactic work than Hegel's [Phenomenology
of Spirit]{.class_s1fv}?
:::

::: {#part0005.xhtml#page_19 .class_s2s}
The secret model of the present book is my favorite work of E.L.
Doctorow, [Lives of the Poets: A Novella and Six Stories]{.class_s1fv}:
six completely disparate short stories (with some subterranean echoes
between them) are followed by a novella about a New York writer from
which it becomes clear that the stories are fragments of the writer's
imagined autobiography. This book could also have been subtitled: "A
Treatise and Seven Essays": seven essays on disparate topics (neuralink,
theology of the Fall, deadlocks of the construction of Socialism in the
early USSR, a new police state of digital control ...) are followed by a
more substantial treatise which refers to all that precedes in order to
account for the philosophical implications of the prospect of a wired
brain.
:::

::: class_s2s
We begin with the political implications of the digitalization of our
lives: are we approaching a new police state? From digitalization and
digital control in general, we move to the more specific project of the
wired brain, and we supplement its simple, naïve even, description with
some open questions. The problem of how the wired brain will affect our
power relations leads us back to the Soviet bio-cosmism whose vision of
Communism as the space of shared experiences prefigures the gnostic
notion of Singularity -- Andrei Platonov clearly saw the limitations of
such a gnostic notion of Communism. Then we pass to the critical
analysis of the popular theosophical (New Age) reading of Singularity as
the final reunification of Spirit and matter. Insofar as Singularity
promises to undo what Christianity calls the Fall, a link between the
Fall, freedom, and the limitation of our knowledge is explored with the
aim of making clear the contrast between Hegel's notion of
[Aufhebung]{.class_s1fv} and the sublation of our finitude in
Singularity. Next, the self-reflexive structure of the Unconscious is
elaborated with the goal of outlining the contours of a dimension of our
symbolic universe which will elude Singularity. A literary fantasy that
follows tries to imagine the mode of subjectivity that will emerge
through the expansion of wired brains: what if the Cartesian ruminations
of Beckett's "unnamable" show us the way? The premise of the concluding
treatise is that the eventual occurrence of Singularity will obviously
be apocalyptic, but what kind of apocalypse will it be, with or without
a new kingdom that will ensue from it? The passage into post-humanity
clearly marks the end of history as we []{#part0005.xhtml#page_20}knew
it -- but what ends and what begins with it? The reader should not look
for detailed predictions here: this book is a philosophical reflection
which can only surmise as to how our subjectivity will be affected by
the eventual rise of the wired brain. Plus, since our brains will be
wired without us even being aware of it, a new form of freedom and power
will arise which will reside simply in our being able to isolate (or,
rather, disconnect) oneself from Singularity. The prospect of total
digital control of which we are not even aware confronts us brutally
with the basic philosophical question: is our only chance of freedom in
isolation from the space of Singularity, or is there a dimension of
being-human which in principle eludes Singularity even if we are fully
immersed in it?
:::

::: class_s2s
So in some sense, this book is also a series of essays on the paradox of
indirectness which haunts philosophy from its beginnings: why a detour
in our approach to a thing offers more than a direct attempt to seize
it. This paradox works at a multitude of levels. Why can we approach
truth only through lies and deceptive illusions, i.e., why do we miss
the truth itself if we ignore the cobweb of lies that surrounds it?
Winston Churchill was right when he wrote truth is so precious that it
has to be protected by a thick defensive wall of lies. Why can an
artistic fiction render the essence of an epoch much more faithfully
than its documentary description? Why do we learn more about Elizabethan
England from Shakespeare's plays than from detailed works on history?
And, last but not least, why does a direct approach to an erotic object
provides less pleasure than the complex strategy of postponing the
encounter and circulating around the object? Two thinkers elaborated in
detail this paradox of indirectness: Hegel and Lacan. The basic premise
of the Hegelian dialectics is that the path to truth is a moment of
truth itself: truth is ultimately nothing other than the systematic
articulation of a succession of errors. Lacan introduced the concept of
surplus-enjoyment precisely in order explain why the postponement of
pleasure, its prohibition even, generates an enjoyment of its own.
Today, with the explosive development of digital technologies, this
problem of indirectness is aggravated to the extreme. Digitalization
makes our most intimate experiences indirect: pornography is becoming a
part of our daily erotic life, and we are more and more approaching
reality itself []{#part0005.xhtml#page_21}through digital media which
not only render it faithfully but even enhance it. However, new trends
in cognitive sciences and technologies open up the prospect of direct
participation in others' thought and experiences, by-passing the medium
of language and other forms of communication -- how will this affect our
being-human?
:::

::: class_s2s
So, again, this is not a book about Hegel, this is a book about how a
latter-day Hegel would have confronted something that is totally alien
to his universe, the phenomenon of a wired brain, a contemporary version
of Hegel's own infinite judgment "the spirit is a bone" -- our mind is a
digital machine. Hegel says that the true beginning of logic is the
"resolve" to think -- to think anything at all, to do something, even if
not in the sense of a positive action. A Heideggerian would immediately
read this claim as a proof that Hegel remains within the horizon of the
metaphysics of Willing; while this reading can be rejected, the fact
remains the founding role if the resolve signals the dimension of
subjectivity -- but in a very complex way, not just that "somebody has
to think thoughts." The status of "resolve" in Hegel is not
psychological or irrational (an irrational excess external to logic),
but strictly logical, immanent to the logical edifice. This same resolve
has to intervene directly at every important turn when something
radically New emerges: at such turning points, we have to resolve anew
to think if we want to effectively grasp the new phenomenon -- and the
prospect of neuralink is definitely such an occasion.

Where do we stand today with regard to our social freedom? The prospect
of the thorough digitalization of our daily lives combined with scanning
our brain (or tracking our bodily processes with implants) opens up the
realistic possibility of an external machine that will know ourselves,
biologically and psychically, much better than we know ourselves:
registering what we eat, buy, read and watch, and discerning our moods,
fears and satisfactions, the external machine will get a much more
accurate picture of ourselves than our conscious Self which, as we know,
doesn't even exist as a consistent entity. Yuval Harari, who deployed
this
vision,[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1VY}[1](#part0014.xhtml#a1P7){.class_s1fz}
points out that our "Self" is composed of narratives which retroactively
try to impose some consistency on the pandemonium of our experiences,
obliterating experiences and memories which disturb these narratives.
Ideology does not reside primarily in stories invented (by those in
power) to deceive others, it resides in stories invented by subjects to
deceive themselves. But the pandemonium persists, and the machine will
register the discords and will maybe even be able to deal with them in a
much more rational way than our conscious Self. Say, when I have to
decide to marry or not, the machine will register all the shifting
attitudes that haunt me, the past pains and disappointments that I
prefer to sweep under the carpet. And why not extend this prospect even
to political decisions? While my Self can be easily seduced by a
populist demagogue, the machine will take note of all my past
frustrations, it will register the inconsistency between my fleeting
passions and my other opinions -- so why should the machine not vote on
my behalf? So while brain sciences confirm the "post-structuralist" or
[]{#part0006.xhtml#page_24}"deconstructionist" idea that we are stories
we tell ourselves about ourselves, and that these stories are a confused
bricolage, an inconsistent multiplicity of stories with no single Self
totalizing them, it seems to offer (or promise, at least) a way out
which is due to its very disadvantage: precisely because the machine
which reads us all the time is "blind," without awareness, a mechanical
algorithm, it can make decisions which are much more adequate than those
made by human individuals, much more adequate not only with regard to
external reality but also and above all with regard to these individuals
themselves, to what they really want or need:
:::

::: class_s2m
Liberalism sanctifies the narrating self, and allows it to vote in the
polling stations, in the supermarket, and in the marriage market. For
centuries this made good sense, because though the narrating self
believed in all kinds of fictions and fantasies, no alternative system
knew me better. Yet once we have a system that really does know me
better, it will be foolhardy to leave authority in the hands of the
narrating self. Liberal habits such as democratic elections will become
obsolete, because Google will be able to represent even my own political
opinions better than
myself."[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1NW}[2](#part0014.xhtml#a1PH){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
One can make a very realist case for this option: it is not that the
computer which registers our activity is omnipotent and infallible, it
is simply that, on average, its decisions work substantially better than
the decisions of our mind: in medicine, it makes better diagnoses than
our average doctor, etc., up to the exploding algorithmic trading on
stock markets where programs that one can download for free already
outperform financial advisers. One thing is clear: the liberal "true
Self," the free agent which enacts what I "really want," simply doesn't
exist, and fully endorsing this inexistence means abandoning the basic
individualist premise of liberal democracy. The digital machine as the
latest embodiment of the big Other, the "subject supposed to know,"
which operates as a subjectless field of knowledge ...
:::

::: class_s2s
There is, of course, a whole series of questions that persist here.
Harari is aware of them: "In the past, censorship worked by blocking the
flow of information. In the twenty-first century, censorship works by
flooding people with irrelevant information ... In ancient
[]{#part0006.xhtml#page_25}times having power meant having access to
data. Today having power means knowing what to
ignore."[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1SH}[3](#part0014.xhtml#a1HG){.class_s1fz}
Can this ignoring be done by a "blind" machine or does it require a
minimal form of subjectivity?
:::

::: class_s2s
There is a long tradition, in philosophy and in the sciences, of denying
free will, but doubts about free will "don't really change history
unless they have a practical impact on economics, politics, and
day-to-day life. Humans are masters of cognitive dissonance, and we
allow ourselves to believe one thing in the laboratory and an altogether
different thing in the courthouse or in
parliament."[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1J3}[4](#part0014.xhtml#a1U4){.class_s1fz}
Harari points out how even popular champions of the new scientific world
like Dawkins or Pinker, after writing hundreds of pages which debunk
free will and freedom of choice, end up supporting political
liberalism.[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1HF}[5](#part0014.xhtml#a1U5){.class_s1fz}
However, today, "liberalism is threatened not by the philosophical idea
that 'there are no free individuals,' but rather by concrete
technologies. We are about to face a flood of extremely useful devices,
tools and structures that make [no]{.class_s1fv} allowance for the free
will of individual humans. Can democracy, the free market and human
rights survive this
flood?"[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1WM}[6](#part0014.xhtml#a1U6){.class_s1fz} So
if development will render [homo sapiens]{.class_s1fv} obsolete, what
will follow it? A post-human [homo deus]{.class_s1fv} (with abilities
that are traditionally identified as divine), or a quasi-omnipotent
digital machine? Singularity (global consciousness) or blind
intelligence without awareness?
:::

Immersion in singularity is just the first option. The second option: if
machines win, then "humans are in danger of losing their value, because
intelligence is decoupling from
consciousness."[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1U7}[7](#part0014.xhtml#a1RP){.class_s1fz}
This decoupling of intelligence and consciousness confronts us again
with the enigma of consciousness: in spite of numerous rather desperate
attempts, evolutionary biology has no clear answer to what is the
evolutionary function of awareness/consciousness. Consequently, now that
intelligence is decoupling from consciousness, "what will happen to

The third and most realist option: a radical division, much stronger
than the class division, within human society itself. In the near
future, biotechnology and computer algorithms will join their powers in
producing "bodies, brains and minds," with the gap exploding "between
those who know how to engineer bodies and
[]{#part0006.xhtml#page_26}brains and those who do not": "those who ride
the train of progress will acquire divine abilities of creation and
destruction, while those left behind will face
extinction."[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1NA}[9](#part0014.xhtml#a1MB){.class_s1fz}
The main threat is therefore that of the rise of a

small and privileged elite of upgraded humans. These superhumans will
enjoy unheard-of abilities and unprecedented creativity, which will
allow them to go on making many of the most important decisions in the
world ... However, most humans will not be upgraded, and they will
consequently become an inferior caste, dominated by both computer
algorithms and the new superhumans ... Splitting humankind into
biological castes will destroy the foundations of liberal
ideology.[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1K0}[10](#part0014.xhtml#a1GH){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
However, this splitting into casts will also not be as straightforward
as it may appear. How will the new elite be defined? Will the elite be a
special upgraded biological cast with superhuman abilities (which means
that its members will also be controlled and genetically manipulated),
or will they be exempted from control while controlling and manipulating
others? Probably both at the same time. In the suburbs of Shanghai there
are already clinics where rich Western couples go to genetically check
and manipulate their offspring before children are born -- to what
extent will the new elite then be able to control the digital and
biochemical/genetic machines that control them? We don't have the space
here to deal with the vast domain of biogenetic interventions destined
to create new post-human entities -- here is the title and subtitle of
an [El País]{.class_s1fv} report: "Spanish scientists create
human-monkey chimera in China. The team led by Juan Carlos Izpisúa
injected stem cells into the animal embryos as part of research aimed at
finding a way to grow organs for
transplants."[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1PT}[11](#part0014.xhtml#a1SK){.class_s1fz}
Note the usual humanitarian justification -- we are really doing it to
grow organs for transplants, and not for the much more obvious reason to
enhance (or diminish) human capacities in order to create post-human
perfect workers or soldiers. This idea has a long history in the
twentieth century: back in the late 1920s, none other than Stalin for
some time financially supported the "human-ape" project proposed by the
biologist Ilya Ivanov. The idea was that by way of coupling humans and
orangutans, it would be possible to create a perfect worker and soldier
impervious to []{#part0006.xhtml#page_27}pain, tiredness and bad food.
(In his spontaneous racism and sexism, Ivanov, of course, tried to
couple male humans and female apes, plus the humans he used were black
males from Congo since they were supposed to be genetically closer to
apes -- the Soviet state financed an expensive expedition to Congo.) Of
course, when the experiments failed, Ivanov was liquidated.
:::

::: class_s2s
In popular terms, the prospect that opens up here is that of a new
police state -- what kind of police state? We should return here to
Hegel and his polemics with Fichte. Fichte is often ridiculed not only
for his subjective-idealist postulate of the absolute I's self-positing
(a philosophical version of Baron Münchhausen's claim that he saved
himself from the swamp in which he was drowning by pulling himself up by
his own hair); he is also regularly denounced as the precursor of the
modern police state which totally controls its citizens. His own words
seem to confirm this scathing judgment:
:::

::: class_s2m
In a state with the kind of constitution we have established here, every
citizen has his own determinate status, and the police know fairly well
where each one is at every hour of the day, and what he is doing ... In
such a state crime is highly unusual and is preceded by a certain
unusual activity. In a state where everything is ordered and runs
according to plan, the police will observe any unusual activity and take
notice
immediately.[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1T3}[12](#part0014.xhtml#a1RS){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
Zdravko Kobe, in his concise description of Fichte's well-ordered state,
is thus right to claim that, in it,
:::

::: class_s2m
the police turns out to be omnipresent. It is not merely that, as he
famously proposed, every person should carry an identity card with his
or her picture inside, so that the police could identify anyone on the
spot, or that bills of exchange should be printed on special paper
accessible exclusively to state authorities, which would make
counterfeiting virtually impossible. In order to protect citizens from
crime in an effective way, the police should, Fichte claims, also put
major emphasis on the prevention of transgressions and direct its
activities not only against actual injuries but also against their very
possibility ... The final objective of police regulations is thus to
establish a transparent order that would render unlawful actions
materially
impossible.[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1N5}[13](#part0014.xhtml#a1G0){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: {#part0006.xhtml#page_28 .class_s2p}
Already in his first book published in 1801, Hegel rejected Fichte's
"preventive intellect and its coercive authority, the police," and
denounced Fichte as a control freak: "In Fichte's state every citizen
will keep at least another half dozen busy with supervision, and so on
ad
infinitum."[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1V3}[14](#part0014.xhtml#a1WB){.class_s1fz}
In the unpublished fragments on the German constitution from 1802/03, he
reiterated this critique:
:::

::: class_s2m
It is ... a basic prejudice of those recent theories which have been
partially translated into practice that a state is a machine with a
single spring which imparts movement to all the rest of its infinite
mechanism, and that all the institutions which the essential nature of a
society brings with it should emanate from the supreme political
authority and be regulated, commanded, supervised, and directed by
it.[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1T6}[15](#part0014.xhtml#a1VP){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
In contrast to Fichte's "pedantic craving to determine every detail,"
Hegel claimed that "the state should rather establish a clear
distinction between what is essential to its existence and unity and
what can be left to chance and arbitrary
will":[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1TK}[16](#part0014.xhtml#a1G2){.class_s1fz}
the state should "demand of the individual only what is necessary for
itself," and "grant the citizens their living freedom and individual
will and even leave considerable scope for the
latter":[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1NH}[17](#part0014.xhtml#a1G3){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2m
The center, as the political authority and government, must leave to the
freedom of the citizens whatever is not essential to its own role of
organising and maintaining authority ... nothing should be so sacred to
it as the approval and protection of the citizens' free activity in such
matters, regardless of utility; for this freedom is inherently
sacred.[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1KA}[18](#part0014.xhtml#a1WT){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
Advocates of Hegel like to quote such passages to quell the suspicion
that he was a proto-totalitarian admirer of the State. However, the
prospect of digitalization of our lives throws a new light on this
opposition between Fichte and Hegel: it is as if the moment of Fichte's
revenge against Hegel has arrived. When Hegel mockingly remarks that, in
Fichte's state, "every citizen will keep at least another half dozen
busy with supervision, and so on ad infinitum," we cannot help but
notice that this refutation of Fichte's vision on empirical grounds no
longer holds: with a complex digital network permanently registering our
activities, the control envisaged by []{#part0006.xhtml#page_29}Fichte
is today not only possible but largely already a fact. The digital
registering of all our acts (plus of our health, our reading habits, our
opinions and dispositions ...) ultimately aims precisely at predicting
our violations of the law and then acting preventively to make it
impossible for us to do it.
:::

::: class_s2s
What makes things even worse is the fact that there is an important
difference between Fichte's project of police control and today's
emerging reality of digital control: Fichte's vision remains
"totalitarian" in the standard sense of an external agency openly
controlling us, while today's digital control is not experienced as an
external limitation of our freedom. What we get here is a unique new
form of the "unity of the opposites" where subjective exercise of
freedom coincides with objective control. It is easy to see the
structural homology between this paradox and the general vision of
neuralink where a short-circuit Hegel wasn't able to imagine (a direct
material unity of thought and digital material reality) is realized.
:::

::: class_s2s
The most dangerous threat to freedom does not come from an openly
authoritarian power; it takes place when our non-freedom itself is
experienced as freedom. Since permissiveness and free choice are
elevated into a supreme value, social control and domination can no
longer appear as infringing on the subject's freedom: it has to appear
as (and be sustained by) the very self-experience of individuals as
free. There is a multitude of forms of this appearing of un-freedom in
the guise of its opposite: when we are deprived of universal healthcare,
we are told that we are given a new freedom of choice (to choose our
healthcare provider); when we can no longer rely on long-term employment
and are compelled to search for new precarious work every couple of
years, we are told that we are given the opportunity to reinvent
ourselves and discover new unexpected creative potential that has lurked
in our personality; when we have to pay for the education of our
children, we are told that we become "entrepreneurs of the self," acting
like a capitalist who has to choose freely how he will invest the
resources he possesses (or borrowed) -- in education, health, travel ...
Constantly bombarded by imposed "free choices," forced to make decisions
for which we are mostly not even properly qualified (or possess enough
information about), we more and more experience our freedom as a burden
that causes unbearable anxiety.
:::

::: {#part0006.xhtml#page_30 .class_s2s}
Furthermore, most of our activities (and passivities) are now registered
in some digital cloud which also permanently evaluates us, tracing not
only our acts but also our emotional states; when we experience
ourselves as free to the utmost (surfing the web where everything is
available), we are totally "externalized" and subtly manipulated. The
digital network gives new meaning to the old slogan "personal is
political." And it's not only the control of our intimate lives that is
at stake: everything is today regulated by some digital network, from
transport to health, from electricity to water. That's why the web is
our most important commons today, and the struggle for its control is
[the]{.class_s1fv} struggle today. The enemy is the combination of
privatized and state-controlled commons, corporations (Google, Facebook)
and state security agencies (NSA). This fact alone renders insufficient
the traditional liberal notion of representative power: citizens
transfer part of their power to the state, but on precise terms (this
power is constrained by law, limited to very precise conditions in the
way it is exercised, since the people remain the ultimate source of
sovereignty and can repeal power if they decide to do so). In short, the
state with its power is the minor partner in a contract which the major
partner (the people) can at any point repeal or change, basically in the
same way each of us can change the supermarket where we buy our
provisions ... This, however, is not what is going on today. One should
strongly qualify the claim, often made today, that
:::

::: class_s2m
the state no longer disposes with devices needed to regulate civil
society and does not induce the attachment that once derived from the
formation process of civil society. In short, the state withers away.
What remains is civil society pure, and its police. We are left with a
police without a state, with a police that has assumed the role of the
state. The interface of the universal without the universal, the police
as a state -- this is the disturbing problem that should agitate our
society.[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1TC}[19](#part0014.xhtml#a1PA){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
When the state starts to wither away, we don't get a police which is
directly rooted in civil society, i.e., some kind of people's militia
which gives form to (or expresses) community, overcoming the gap that
separates society from state. Since society is in itself antagonistic,
i.e., since the antagonism between state and society is a secondary
[]{#part0006.xhtml#page_31}effect of the antagonism that cuts across
society itself, all such "militias" are a direct expression of one side
of society against the other(s). The reality of the police without state
is the pure police state -- why? Here we should raise the question: is
the state really withering away in today's global capitalism? Is it not
becoming stronger than ever, not only regulating civil society but
directly intervening in it and collaborating with (parts of) it? The
emblem of today's "policing" aimed at preventing crime is the direct
collaboration between state apparatuses and corporations which deal with
control and information -- Julian Assange was right to designate Google
as a private-corporate version of a National Security Agency.
:::

::: class_s2s
Police is closer to civil society than state; it is a kind of
representative of state in civil society, but for this very reason it
has to be experienced as an external force, not an inner ethical power.
Civil society is the domain of the pursuit of particular private
interests, of private freedom, and this freedom can (without being
destroyed) only be limited from the outside. This is why it is
ridiculous to equate civil society crimes with breaches of ethics with
regard to the state. In civil society, what matters is that you don't
break the law (and are not discovered doing it), and all the legal
tricks (bending the letter of the law against its spirit) are allowed
here. The force of law [must]{.class_s1fv} remain an external force.
This is why it us totally wrong and potentially "totalitarian" to talk
about police embedded in civil society, a police whose authority does
not emanate from the state since it functions as a self-organization of
the people themselves -- this is "people's militia," and no wonder that
Communist regimes tended to call their police "militia." Who organizes
militias today? Neo-fascist right-wingers like Orban in Hungary who
appealed to ordinary people to organize militia groups to search for
illegal immigrants. Police is state power as it appears within the
sphere of civil society in which individuals pursue their private
interests; it is in its nature an external "mechanic" force, a
counterpart to the abstract liveliness of individual interests. Militia
is, on the contrary, precisely because of its "organic" character, a
direct negation of the individual freedom that is essential to civil
society. This brings us back to our starting point: today, "militia"
acquires a new form in the network of digital control baptized by
Shoshana Zuboff "surveillance capitalism":
:::

::: {#part0006.xhtml#page_32 .class_s2m}
It works by providing free services that billions of people cheerfully
use, enabling the providers of those services to monitor the behaviour
of those users in astonishing detail -- often without their explicit
consent ... "Surveillance capitalism", she writes, "unilaterally claims
human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioural
data". Although some of these data are applied to service improvement,
the rest are declared as a proprietary behavioural surplus, fed into
advanced manufacturing processes known as "machine intelligence", and
fabricated into prediction products that anticipate what you will do
now, soon, and later. Finally, these prediction products are traded in a
new kind of marketplace that I call behavioural futures markets ...
Knowledge, authority and power rest with surveillance capital, for which
we are merely "human natural resources". We are the native peoples now
whose claims to self-determination have vanished from the maps of our
own
experience.[]{#part0006.xhtml#a1J8}[20](#part0014.xhtml#a1UK){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
We, the watched, are not just material, we are also exploited, involved
in an unequal exchange, which is why the term "behavioural surplus"
(playing the role of surplus-value) is fully justified here: when we are
surfing, buying, watching TV, etc., we get what we want, but we give
more -- we lay ourselves bare, we make the details of our life and its
habits transparent to the digital big Other. The paradox is, of course,
that we experience this unequal exchange, the activity which effectively
enslaves us, as our highest exercise of freedom -- what is more free
than freely surfing on the web? Just by exerting this freedom of ours,
we generate the "surplus" appropriated by the digital big Other which
collects data.

Although the rise of "surveillance capitalism" has far-reaching
consequences, it is not yet the true game changer: there is much greater
potential for new forms of domination in the prospect of direct
brain[-]{.class_s1fv}machine interface. One can safely surmise that all
kinds of secret agencies are working intensely on it -- what we learn is
just the public face of it, the often sensational news about it in our
media. The best-known project in this direction is Neuralink, an
American neurotechnology company founded by Elon Musk and eight others,
and dedicated to developing implantable brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs), also called a neural-control interface
(NCIs), mind-machine interface (MMIs), or direct neural
interface (DNIs) -- all these terms indicate the same idea of a direct
communication pathway, first between an enhanced or wired brain and an
external device, and then between brains
themselves.[]{#part0007.xhtml#a1U2}[1](#part0014.xhtml#a1PU){.class_s1fz}

There are thus two steps in this direct communication: first, when our
brain is connected to digital machines, we can cause things to happen in
reality just by thinking about them (I direct my thought at the TV
screen, and the selected program starts to play; I direct my thoughts at
the coffee machine, and the coffee gets made; etc.); then, my brain
directly connected to another brain, so that my thoughts are directly
shared by another individual (I daydream about an intense sexual
experience and another individual can directly share my experience). The
gradual development of communication in the direction of adding
additional layers of mediation -- spoken word, writing, telegraph,
phone, internet ... -- is here cut short, and the prospect of direct
link by-passing these additional layers emerges, so that we pass from

::: class_s2p
The consequence of this direct brain-to-brain communication is not just
greater speed, but also accuracy: when I think about something, I don't
have to translate my thought into linguistic signs which brutally
simplify meaning, my partner directly perceives what I think -- or, to
quote Musk himself:
:::

::: class_s2m
There are a bunch of concepts in your head that then your brain has to
try to compress into this incredibly low data rate called speech or
typing. That's what language is -- your brain has executed a compression
algorithm on thought, on concept transfer. And then it's got to listen
as well, and decompress what's coming at it. And this is very lossy as
well. So, then when you're doing the decompression on those, trying to
understand, you're simultaneously trying to model the other person's
mind state to understand where they're coming from, to recombine in your
head what concepts they have in their head that they're trying to
communicate to you ... If you have two brain interfaces, you could
actually do an uncompressed direct conceptual communication with another
person ... If I were to communicate a concept to you, you would
essentially engage in consensual telepathy. You wouldn't need to
verbalize unless you want to add a little flair to the conversation or
something (laughs), but the conversation would be conceptual interaction
on a level that's difficult to conceive of right now ... That's the
thing -- it's difficult to really understand what it would be like
to [think ]{.class_s1fv}with someone. We've never been able to try. We
communicate with ourselves []{#part0007.xhtml#page_35}through thought
and with everyone else through symbolic representations of thought, and
that's all we can imagine.
:::

::: class_s2p
What's difficult to conceive is the idea of directly sharing intimate
experiences: "Say you're on a beautiful hike and you want to show your
husband the view. No problem -- just think out to him to request a brain
connection. When he accepts, connect your retina feed to his visual
cortex. Now his vision is filled with exactly what your eyes see, as if
he's there. He asks for the other senses to get the full picture, so you
connect those too and now he hears the waterfall in the distance and
feels the breeze and smells the trees and jumps when a bug lands on your
arm." And what is more logical than to extend this idea onto the domain
of sexuality: "You could save a great sex experience in the cloud to
enjoy again later -- or, if you're not too private a person, you could
send it over to a friend to experience. (Needless to say, the porn
industry will thrive in the digital brain world.)"
:::

::: class_s2s
The first and rather obvious philosophical reproach to this vision
arises from the so-called "externalist" theory of consciousness: my
self-awareness is not "in my brain," it is rooted in my individual
bodily existence, it is meaningful only within this horizon, as a moment
of my concrete embodied existence which comprises the thick web of my
interactions with others. So what survives of my mental state
(experience) if it is torn from this concrete context? What if
experiences can only be shared in some quasi-religious abstract
collective trance which obliterates all divergence? The latest version
of the "radical externalist" position was deployed by Riccardo
Manzotti -- here is Tim Parks's description of Manzotti's claim that my
experience is "out of my head":
:::

::: class_s2m
For the rainbow experience to happen we need sunshine, raindrops, and a
spectator. It is not that the sun and the raindrops cease to exist if
there is no one there to see them. Manzotti is not a Bishop Berkeley.
But unless someone is present at a particular point no colored arch can
appear. The rainbow is hence a process requiring various elements, one
of which happens to be an instrument of sense perception. It doesn't
exist whole and separate in the world nor does it exist as an acquired
image in the head separated from what is perceived (the view held by the
"internalists" who account []{#part0007.xhtml#page_36}for the majority
of neuroscientists); rather, consciousness is spread between sunlight,
raindrops, and visual cortex, creating a unique, transitory new whole,
the rainbow experience. Or again: the viewer doesn't see the world; he
is part of a world
process.[]{#part0007.xhtml#a1JM}[2](#part0014.xhtml#a1TE){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
(From a Marxist viewpoint, one should add here that what forms human
perceptions is not just the whole of experience but also the way
perceptions are embedded into the totality of human activity, as a
moment of the interaction between humans themselves and between humans
and non-human objects and processes: what we perceive and how we
perceive what we perceive is always overdetermined by our practical
interests.) I see a double problem with this stance. First: yes, my
perception of a rainbow is spread between sunlight, raindrops, and
visual cortex, creating a unique, transitory new whole, the rainbow
experience, so that, when another living being takes a look at the same
piece of reality as me, it doesn't see a rainbow -- but in some sense we
are looking at the same piece of reality, or, rather, my transitory
whole (of perceiving rainbow) and another's transitory whole of seeing
something different partially overlap. How are we to think this Real in
which both transitory wholes co-exist? To make this point clearer, let's
replace rainbow with a table: the point is not that we should strive to
isolate the same isolated "real" table that remains the same when each
of us perceives it in a different way, but simply that of thinking the
shared space in which different "transitory wholes" co-exist. I think
the topological model of the twisted space of a Klein bottle helps
here:[]{#part0007.xhtml#a1JF}[3](#part0014.xhtml#a1V2){.class_s1fz} the
Real is not a transcendent thing-in-itself at which we arrive when we
abstract from all our perceptual distortions but the fluid
"unorientable" space in which, through reflexive turns-into-oneself,
multiple realities can emerge. To put it in Leibnizean terms, we are
dealing here with a kind of extended monads which partially overlap with
regard to their content, and the problem is how to think the space of
their co-existence since there is no divine absolute that would
encompass them all.
:::

::: class_s2s
Second: it is a little bit too easy to say that "the viewer doesn't see
the world; he is part of a world process": in some radical sense, I (as
a viewing subject) am never directly part of the world in which my
perception takes place since every reality that I perceive already
[]{#part0007.xhtml#page_37}relies on my specific subjective
standpoint -- by definition I cannot directly locate myself in reality
since this would mean that I somehow stepped out of myself and looked at
myself "objectively," from nowhere. This means that I as a subject am
not directly part of the world: I of course have no substantial reality
out of the world, but I am the void (what Hegel calls the pure
self-relating negativity) that enables the constitution of a specific
reality (Manzotti's "transitory whole") in the midst of the chaotic
unorientable Real.
:::

::: class_s2s
Back to Singularity: it may appear that, if we endorse the radical
externalist view, then the prospect of shared experiences through a
wired brain should be denounced as a dead end. That is to say, since the
reality that we perceive is not an image in our head but outside our
head, located in the whole of my brain, the perceived objects or
processes and their interaction, even if a machine can fully reproduce
my brain processes, it cannot reproduce our experience of what I see
since it reduces it to what goes on in my brain and by definition misses
the complex whole in which my experience is located ... However, the
case is far from conclusive: the complex interaction of my brain with
its environment gives rise to complex meaningful experiences, but this
interaction has to be somehow registered in my brain, so that by
reproducing the neuronal processes in my brain it could be possible to
generate in another subject to share the same experience. Does something
like this not happen when I feel a missing limb? Of course such an
experience can only arise out of the concrete interaction between me, my
body and its environs, but it remains registered in my brain and can be
"pathologically" resuscitated even when the limb is missing.
:::

::: class_s2s
We should not be too surprised by the prospect of mind-controlled
machines: is my body not already a kind of mind-controlled machine, an
organism directly regulated by my mind? The catch is, of course, that my
body is mine -- I am directly emdedded in it, while a machine is
external to me. However, the prospect of a wired brain introduces a
crack into this immediacy: if it is possible for an external machine to
directly register my thoughts, does this not imply that I am also not
directly my body, i.e., that my body is also external to me, that I am
in some sense outside myself?
:::

::: {#part0007.xhtml#page_38 .class_s2s}
However, even if we endorse the feasibility of shared experiences,
various questions arise here. The first concerns the role of language in
the formation of our thoughts and of our "inner life" in general. Musk
simply assumes that our thoughts are present in our mind independently
of their expression in language, so that if I connect my brain directly
with another's brain, the other individual will experience my thoughts
directly in all their wealth and finesse, not distorted by the
clumsiness and simplification of language. However, what if language in
all its clumsiness and simplifications generates the elusive wealth of
our thoughts? Yes, language reduces the mess of our thoughts to simple
words and sentences -- say, when I say to somebody "I love you!," the
wealth of my feelings is reduced to a simple formula pronounced
thousands of times every day. However, this very condensation of the
chaotic wealth creates complex meaning, it evokes the rich texture of
what is left unsaid. We are here automatically victims of a fetishist
illusion: the surplus of "deeper meaning" left unsaid is not already
there and just discovered or alluded to, it is generated by the
reduction of our thoughts to simple linguistic formulas. Suffice it to
recall a simple substitution of "a boat" for "a sail": the boat is
reduced to one of its parts, but this reduction in itself gives birth to
a web of meanings which reach far beyond a simple "boat."
:::

::: class_s2s
One could play here with the Hegelian variations: a thought's true
content actualizes itself only through its linguistic expression --
prior to this expression, it is nothing substantial, just a confused
inner intention. When speaking, I only learn what I wanted to say by
effectively saying it. We think in words: even when we see and
experience things and processes as particular entities, their perception
is already structured through our symbolic network. Say, when I see a
gun in front of me, all the meanings associated with it are symbolically
overdetermined -- in short, I perceive a gun but this perception is
given its specific spin by the word "gun" that resonates in it, and
words always refer to universal notions. Therein resides the paradox of
the symbolic overdetermination: when I perceive a gun in front of me, it
is the abstract-universal word "gun" associated with it which confers on
my perception the rich and complex texture of meaning that colors this
perception.
:::

::: {#part0007.xhtml#page_39 .class_s2s}
However, this key role of words in our experience of meaning does not
automatically devalue the project of neuralink: all one has to do to
save this project is to abandon Musk's premise that thoughts are present
in our mind independently of their expression in language. Insofar as
neuralink will register our inner flow of experience, why could it not
register also the verbal material present in our mind, words in which we
think -- words reduced to mental representations, but still
words?[]{#part0007.xhtml#a1S4}[4](#part0014.xhtml#a1MD){.class_s1fz} The
core of the problem resides elsewhere: in the fact that the very
reduction of the material support of the expression of an idea can
strengthen the expressed content (meaning). To illustrate this key
point, Hegel evokes a wonderful example from the sphere of education. He
notices that small children prefer to draw images using colors, while
later they prefer to do them in grey, with a colorless pencil. Humanist
theorists of education see in this the oppressive result of educational
violence: children's creativity is thwarted, they are forced to express
themselves wearing the straitjacket of colorlessness ... Hegel's
reading, however, is exactly the opposite: it is this reduction to
colorless space that, by way of reducing the sensuous wealth, enables
the children to articulate the higher spiritual dimension.

The tragic fate of Eisenstein's [Bezhin Meadow]{.class_s1fv}, his first
sound film, is the stuff of
legend.[]{#part0007.xhtml#a1MC}[5](#part0014.xhtml#a1UD){.class_s1fz}
Commissioned by a Communist youth group, the film's production ran from
1935 to 1937, until it was halted by the central Soviet government,
which said it contained artistic, social and political failures. In the
1960s, it was learned that Eisenstein's wife, Pera Atasheva, had saved
splices of film from the editing table. Starting in 1964, a
reconstruction of the film was created (and set to a musical score
by Sergei Prokofiev) by Sergei Yutkevich with Naum Kleiman. The film was
edited to the original script, to preserve the original cutting
continuity; new intertitles were also created from the script, and a new
spoken introduction was added. The film now exists as a 35-minute
"silent film slide show," something like Chris Marker's [La
Jetée]{.class_s1fv} from 1962, a 28-minute-long featurette shot in black
and white which is constructed almost entirely from still photos (and
which tells the story of a post-nuclear-war experiment in time travel).
Like Cindy Sherman's series of untitled movie stills (from non-existing
movies, sometimes even with subtitles of dialogues added), Marker's
[]{#part0007.xhtml#page_40}reduction of the cinematic flow to a
succession of motionless stills is intentional -- part of his artistic
project. The situation with [Bezhin Meadow]{.class_s1fv} is more
ambiguous: the reduction to a silent-film slide show is, of course, not
part of the original project; it resulted from the desperate attempt to
save whatever could be saved and somehow render presentable the
remaining raw material. However, the result is so impressive that one
cannot but entertain a doubt: what if the reduction to stills makes it a
better film than Eisenstein's lost original, a full talking movie? What
if it not only produces a poetic effect of its own, but also makes us
imagine the "real" continuous action in a much richer way than its
direct rendering in a continuous movie shot?

What we find in human sexuality is the obverse of simplification which
gives birth to a surplus: an unnecessary complication which prevents the
direct access to a goal. Human sexuality comes in a variety of perverted
forms and procedures which not only cannot be reduced to different ways
to reach the same goal of procreation but often run directly against
this goal. However, one should always bear in mind that this excessive
diversity is set in motion by an underlying impossibility or antagonism.
This is why, from the psychoanalytic standpoint, one thing is sure: what
the shift to the post-human amounts to at its most fundamental is the
overcoming (leaving behind) of the sexual in its most radical
ontological dimension -- not just "sexuality" as a specific sphere of
human existence but the sexual as an antagonism, the bar of an
impossibility, constitutive of being-human in its finitude. Therein
resides the lesson of transgender: we have the masculine, the feminine,
and their antagonism (difference) as such. Transgender individuals are
different (from the established difference) and, as such, they are the
difference itself -- the difference from the established difference is
the difference itself. That's why the third category, those who do not
fit the hegemonic binary of masculine and feminine, are "universal" and
"different": they stand for universality precisely insofar as they are
radically different, i.e., insofar as they do not have a proper place in
the established order. (In exactly the same way, the third type of
public toilets demanded by transgender, neither male nor female, can be
called "universal" or "(for those) different.")
:::

::: {#part0007.xhtml#page_41 .class_s2s}
And the issue carefully avoided by the partisans of the new asexual man
is: to what extent are many other features usually identified with
being-human, features like art, creativity, consciousness, etc.,
dependent on the antagonism that constitutes the sexual? This is why the
addition of "asexual" to the series of sexual positions listed by the
partisans of LGBT+ is crucial and unavoidable: the endeavor to liberate
sexuality from all "binary" oppressions to set it free in its entire
polymorphous perversity, necessarily ends up in the abandoning of the
very sphere of sexuality -- the liberation OF sexuality has to end up in
the liberation (of humanity) FROM sexuality.

Sexuality also provides the basic matrix of the dialectical reversal of
failure into success. Since France is the land of love and seduction, no
wonder French cuisine, the paradigm of high cuisine, works in this way:
is the origin of many of its famous dishes or drinks not that, when they
wanted to produce a standard piece of food or drink, something went
wrong, but then they realized that this failure can be re-sold as
success? They were making cheese in the usual way, but then the cheese
got rotten and infected, smelling bad, and they found this monstrosity
(measured by the usual standards) charming in its own way; they were
making wine in the usual way when something went wrong with the
fermentation, and so they began to produce champagne ... And is this not
exactly how our (human) sexuality works? Something goes terribly wrong
(measured by the standards of simple instinctual mating), but this
failure is then endorsed and cultivated as the resource of new sexual
pleasures. Can we imagine anything more stupid (from the standpoint of
successful reproduction) than the tradition of courtly love in which the
completion of the sexual act is endlessly postponed? So how could
courtly love become the model of high eroticism? And what about our
perverted games in which a particular object or gesture which should be
constrained to a subordinated moment of erotic foreplay becomes the
central feature, the focus of libidinal intensity which eclipses the big
procreative Act? Is this dimension of erotic mediation not threatened by
a direct brain-to-brain link?

In the British TV series [Doc Martin]{.class_s1fv} which takes place in
a small Cornish seaside village, the dates between the two main
characters, Martin, a doctor who has moved there from London, and
Louisa, a []{#part0007.xhtml#page_42}teacher at the local school,
repeatedly go wrong because of his distant attitude (after kissing her,
he tells her that there must be something wrong with her stomach because
of her bad breath, etc.), so she breaks off with him and they politely
ignore each other, limiting their interaction to the necessary minimum.
When, after one such cold encounter, he leaves her house, he just turns
around near the entrance, approaches her again and says with a desperate
voice "Marry me!," to which she quickly replies "Yes," and they
passionately embrace ... There is no gradual warming up, no patient work
to repair the broken ties: when things go wrong between the two of them,
their predicament is reduced to the bare fact that they really love each
other, the fact which explodes in all its naked force. This is how
success (the couple's triumphant reunion) can only take place after and
through a series of failures.

The cliffhanger finale of the second season of the TV series
[Succession]{.class_s1fv} (2019) is another superb example of such a
reversal. Logan Roy, the patriarch of his super-rich family and the boss
of the large media corporation Waystar Royco, gathers on his yacht his
three sons and a daughter, plus some other top managers, in the final
countdown to the shareholder meeting that will determine the company's
ownership. They all know that, due to a big sex-exploitation scandal, a
"blood sacrifice" will have to be performed, i.e., a top member of the
family (main shareholders suggest Logan himself) will have to be
sacrificed. He or she should publicly state that he is solely
responsible for the scandal and thereby assume full responsibility
since, as he will state in his confession, nobody else at the top knew
about it. The previous evening, Logan has a private conversation with
Kendall, his second oldest son, who is primed to lead the company after
him. Although the relationship between the two has always been full of
tensions, Logan tells him that he really appreciates his ingenuity and
intelligence; but when Kendall asks him if he ever considered him as his
successor at the top of the corporation, Logan says that Kendall
nonetheless lacks a key feature of the head of a corporation, the
readiness to kill, to ruthlessly destroy the opponent when this is
needed. So when the family is gathered, Logan informs them that Kendall
will be sacrificed: he will have to appear at a senate hearing and
assume all responsibility, thereby saving his family's company.
[]{#part0007.xhtml#page_43}Kendall graciously agrees to perform this
act, but when he appears at the hearing, he turns into a killer,
denouncing Logan, his own father, as being solely responsible for the
scandal and for other illegal activities in the corporation, plus
announcing that he will soon make public documents proving all of this.
The reversal comes in the final seconds when we see Logan (who watches
Kendall's public statement on the TV) with a mysterious smile of
satisfaction -- what does this smile mean? Brian Cox (who plays Logan)
explained it in an interview with [Vulture]{.class_s1fv}: "There was a
certain inevitability to it ... Logan is really setting Kendall up to
become the man he has not been." This ties back into the conversation
the previous evening where Logan informs Kendall of his
blood-sacrificedom, and where he refers to the prophecy where a son was
annihilated so brutally that he would rise again:
:::

::: class_s2m
Logan knew in order to sacrifice himself, he would have to do it through
his family. He figured that the one chance he had was to make Kendall
into the killer. That's why, at the end, he smiles. He's achieved what
he was after. "My son has come of age. He's now officially a killer" ...
Once Logan received the death sentence, it was important to him who'd
deliver the death. He wanted to keep it within the family, as opposed to
it coming from outside of the family. The smile is him saying, "Finally,
my son is stepping up to the plate, doing what he needs to do to run a
business. Finally, he's the heir apparent to Waystar
Royco."[]{#part0007.xhtml#a1NB}[6](#part0014.xhtml#a1G1){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
In short, Logan knew that he himself would have to be sacrificed in
order to save the company, and his gesture of sacrificing Kendall is
well calculated: he knows that Kendall will betray him and turn against
him, and that by performing this act, Kendall will become a killer,
thereby acquiring the quality he lacked in order to be the next boss of
the corporation. So the true sacrifice is not Kendall's but Logan's, and
the only question that remains open is: was Kendall himself aware of
this double game, i.e., was the entire plan coordinated between father
and son, or did Kendall really think that he was to be sacrificed? If we
follow Logan's impeccable logic, Kendall's strike had to be sincere: the
top had to be sacrificed, but to keep the company in the family, the
killing strike had to come from the family itself; and to make the
strike believable for the []{#part0007.xhtml#page_44}public, it had to
appear that the killer (Kendall) was sincere ... If Logan's plan is to
succeed, he has to be betrayed for real, not just as part of some
intricate family

Such a positive spin of a failure can best be illustrated by the loop of
symbolic representation: a subject endeavors to adequately represent
itself, this representation fails, and the subject [is]{.class_s1fv} the
result of this failure. Recall what one might be tempted to call the
"Hugh-Grant-paradox" (referring to the famous scene from [Four Weddings
and a Funeral]{.class_s1fv}): the hero tries to articulate his love to
the beloved, he gets caught in stumbling and confused repetitions, and
it is this very failure to deliver his message of love in a perfect way
that bears witness to its authenticity ... This paradox makes it clear
why, as Hegel put it in his [Phenomenology]{.class_s1fv}, we can say our
speech and our labor "express the inner too much as we can say that they
express it too little. Too much -- because the inner itself breaks out
in these expressions, no opposition remains between them and the inner;
they do not merely provide an expression of the inner, they immediately
provide the inner itself. Too little -- because in speech and action the
inner makes itself into an other and thereby abandons itself to the
mercy of the element of transformation, which twists the spoken word and
the accomplished deed and makes something else out of them than what
they, as the actions of this determinate individual, are in and for
themselves."[]{#part0007.xhtml#a1ST}[8](#part0014.xhtml#a1M7){.class_s1fz}
They express it too little because they cannot ever capture adequately
our inner intention: we always fail to put into words what we wanted to
say. Simultaneously, they express it too much because in and through
this very failure they express more than we wanted to say, the truth of
what we subjectively meant. We may complement Hegel here: this "too
much" has two aspects, it can refer to the socially determined
"objective" meaning of our speech (we may mean something as sincere
praise but the predominant use of language makes it a cold cynical
appraisal -- we don't control the effects of our speech), as well as to
the deeper truth about the speaking subject itself (the subject's
failure to say what it really wanted to say may bring out a dimension of
its desire it was not aware of). So instead of bothering with the
question "Can neuralink capture the true meaning of our flow of
thoughts?," we should focus on a different question: can it capture the
overlapping of too little []{#part0007.xhtml#page_45}and too much
indicated by Hegel, can it capture the excess produced by the failure
itself?

Furthermore, it is obvious that Grant's individuality expresses itself
precisely through these failures: if he were to declare his love in a
perfect and smooth way, we would get a robot-like recitation. For this
reason, the next question that arises is: will our individuality survive
this passage into singularity? Technology has so far enhanced our
individuality because it has introduced more alienation, additional
layers in our exchange with others, and even alienating us from
ourselves (our screen image is not directly "ourselves") -- so what
happens when this distance disappears? Musk's first line of defence is
that, in his version of BCI, the individual is not totally immersed in
it: it maintains a minimal distance from it, so that, in order to allow
the machine (or, through it, another individual) to register and/or
share your thoughts and feelings, you have to actively consent to it, to
will it:
:::

::: class_s2m
One concern that comes up when people hear about thought communication
in particular is a potential loss of individuality. Would this make us
one great hive mind with each individual brain as just another bee?
Almost across the board, the experts I talked to believed it would be
the opposite. We could act as one in a collaboration when it served us,
but technology has thus far enhanced human individuality ... People
won't be able to read your thoughts -- you would have to will it. If you
don't will it, it doesn't happen. Just like if you don't will your mouth
to talk, it doesn't talk.
:::

::: class_s2p
But how does Musk know that an individual will maintain this minimal
distance? Remember that BCI works "objectively": our brain is wired,
linked to a machine which, strictly speaking, doesn't "read our
thoughts" but the processes in our brain which are the neuronal
correlate of our thoughts; consequently, since when I think, I am not
aware of the neuronal processes in my brain, how should I know if I am
plugged in or not? Consequently, is it not much more reasonable to
surmise that, when I am plugged into BCI, I will not even be aware when
my inner life is transparent to others? In short, does BCI not offer
itself as the ideal medium of (political) control of the inner life of
individuals? As is the case with []{#part0007.xhtml#page_46}all
inventions that pose a threat to human freedom, their promoters try to
obfuscate the issue by emphasizing dazzling examples of how such
inventions might improved the lives of incapacitated individuals -- here
is a typical report: "Paralysed man walks using mind-controlled
exoskeleton. French patient's breakthrough could lead to
brain-controlled wheelchairs, say

Already in May 2002, it was reported that scientists at New York
University had attached a computer chip able to send signals directly to
a rat's brain, so that it would be possible to control the rat (i.e.,
determine the direction in which it would run) by means of a steering
mechanism (in the same way one as runs a remote-controlled toy car). For
the first time, the "will" of a living animal agent, its "spontaneous"
decisions about the movements it will make, were taken over by an
external machine. Of course, the big philosophical question here is: how
did the unfortunate rat "experience" its movement which was effectively
decided from the outside? Did it continue to "experience" it as
something spontaneous (i.e., was it totally unaware that its movements
were being steered?), or was it aware that "something is wrong," that
another external power was deciding its movements? Even more crucial is
to apply the same reasoning to an identical experiment performed with
humans (which, ethical questions notwithstanding, shouldn't be much more
complicated, technically speaking, than in the case of the rat). In the
case of the rat, one can argue that one should not apply to it the human
category of "experience," while, in the case of a human being, one
should ask this question. So, again, will a steered human being continue
to "experience" his movements as something spontaneous? Will he remain
totally unaware that his movements are steered, or will he become aware
that "something is wrong," that another external power is deciding his
movements? And, how, precisely, will this "external power" appear -- as
something "inside me," an unstoppable inner drive, or as a simple
external coercion? If the subject will remain totally unaware that their
spontaneous behavior is steered from outside, can one really go on
pretending that this has no consequences for our notion of free will?
Most of those who reflect on neuralink focus on the
[]{#part0007.xhtml#page_47}individuality of my experience -- will I lose
it or not when I am immersed in singularity? But there is the opposite
option: what if I retain my individuality in experience and don't even
know that I am controlled and steered?

When people reflect on the implications of BCI, they usually focus on
how our immersion in Singularity will affect us, making us a [homo
deus]{.class_s1fv}: like a divine being I will be able to move things
and trigger processes in reality by merely thinking about it -- the
German idealists called this overlapping of perception and activity
[intellectual intuition]{.class_s1fv}, a perception which creates what
it perceives. Only gods can do this: our finite minds are forever
constrained by the gap that separates thinking or perceiving from
acting. But we should rather take a step back and ask the question: who
will control the chips in our brain which sustains the BCI? Chips are
cheap ... Perhaps the saddest aspect of the vision of neuralink is the
cynical opportunistic calculus that sustains it: we (humans) gave birth
to a higher form of intelligence which, if left alone to deploy its
powers, will reduce us to gorillas in a zoo: "Most posthumanists agree
that it would be ironic if humankind were surpassed by beings that
humans made possible, and tragic if such post-humans did away with
humankind altogether. Still, more than a few posthumanists assert
without nostalgia that evolutionary development is indifferent to the
fate of what came before. For them, the prospect of dramatically
improving ourselves in the process of giving birth to something far
greater than humankind more than justifies taking
risks[]{#part0007.xhtml#a1NN}[10](#part0014.xhtml#a1WE){.class_s1fz}."
The only choice for us to avoid this fate is to join the winner, to
leave behind our humanity and immerse ourselves in Singularity ... But
will all of humanity as a whole "join the winner," or will the emergence
of Singularity give rise to new unheard-of forms of domination, so that
(post)humans themselves will be divided into new winners and losers?

This brings us to the topic neglected by contemporary transhumanists:
what about the social consequences of the passage into Singularity? What
kind of social order does its rise imply? It is clear that contemporary
liberal democracy with its individualism is doomed in this case -- so
what will replace it? Transhumanists limit themselves to occasional
warnings that the other side of the prospect of [homo deus]{.class_s1fv}
is unheard-of possibilities of social and direct mental control. But
there was, back in the 1920s, already a strong tendency of post-humanism
in the USSR: the so-called "bio-cosmism," a strange combination of
vulgar materialism and gnostic spirituality which formed occult
shadow-ideology, the obscene secret teaching, of the Soviet Marxism.
Repressed out of the public sight in the central period of the Soviet
state, bio-cosmism was openly propagated only in the first and in the
last two decades of Soviet rule; its main theses were: the goals of
religion (collective paradise, overcoming of all suffering, full
individual immortality, resurrection of the dead, victory over time and
death, conquest of space far beyond the solar system) can be realized in
terrestrial life through the development of modern science and
technology. In the future, not only would sexual difference be
abolished, with the rise of chaste post-humans reproducing themselves
through direct bio-technical reproduction; it would also be possible to
resurrect all the dead of the past (establishing their biological
formula through their remains and then re-engendering them -- at that
time, DNA was not yet known ...), thus even erasing all past injustices,
"undoing" past suffering and destruction. In this bright bio-political
Communist future, not only humans, but also animals, all living beings,
would participate in a directly collectivized Reason of the cosmos ...
Exemplary is here the vision of Trotsky:

What is man? He is by no means a finished or harmonious being. No, he is
still a highly awkward creature. Man, as an animal, has not evolved by

question of how to educate and regulate, of how to improve and complete
the physical and spiritual construction of man, is a colossal problem
which can only be understood on the basis of socialism ... To produce a

And for that we first have to find out everything about man, his
anatomy, his physiology and that part of his physiology which is called

One should be careful not to miss the theological implications of this
vision: the other side of the replacement of individual personality with
a new form of collective awareness, i.e., of the obliteration of the
barrier that separates my mind from others, is the strengthening of the
barrier that separates my mind from my []{#part0008.xhtml#page_51}bodily
(self-)experience: I am no longer fully embodied, I observe my body in
an emotionless stance, reading its messages as signs of a machine (I
don't feel heat, I register it as a number on my bodily thermometer,
etc.). What we get here is the materialist version of the redemption
from the Fall, something vaguely similar to the unique theology
elaborated by Nicholas Malebranche, a disciple of Descartes, who dropped
Descartes's ridiculous reference to the pineal gland in order to explain
the coordination between the material and the spiritual substance, i.e.
body and soul. How, then, are we to explain their coordination, if there
is no contact between the two, no point at which a soul can act causally
on a body or vice versa? Since the two causal networks (that of ideas in
my mind and that of bodily interconnections) are totally independent,
the only solution is that a third, true Substance (god) continuously
coordinates and mediates between the two, sustaining the semblance of
continuity: when I think about raising my hand and my hand effectively
rises, my thought causes the raising of my hand not directly but only
"occasionally" -- upon noticing my thought directed at raising my hand,
god sets in motion the other, material, causal chain which leads to my
hand effectively being raised. If we replace "God" with the big Other,
the symbolic order, we can see the closeness of occasionalism to Lacan's
position: as Lacan put it in his polemics against Aristotle in
[Television]{.class_s1fv},[]{#part0008.xhtml#a1VD}[3](#part0014.xhtml#a1TY){.class_s1fz}
the relationship between soul and body is never direct, since the big
Other always interposes itself between the two. Occasionalism is thus
essentially a name for the "arbitrary of the signifier," for the gap
that separates the network of ideas from the network of bodily (real)
causality, for the fact that it is the big Other which accounts for the
coordination of the two networks, so that, when my body bites an apple,
my soul experiences a pleasurable sensation. This same gap is targeted
by the ancient Aztec priest who organizes human sacrifices to ensure
that the sun will rise again: the human sacrifice is here an appeal to
god to sustain the coordination between the two series, the bodily
necessity and the concatenation of symbolic events. "Irrational" as the
Aztec priest's sacrificing may appear, its underlying premise is far
more insightful than our commonplace intuition according to which the
coordination between body and soul is direct, i.e. it is "natural" for
me to have a pleasurable sensation when I bite an
[]{#part0008.xhtml#page_52}apple since this sensation is caused directly
by the apple: what gets lost is the intermediary role of the big Other
in guaranteeing the coordination between reality and our mental
experience of it. And is it not the same with our immersion in Virtual
Reality? When I raise my hand in order to push an object in the virtual
space, this object effectively moves -- my illusion, of course, is that
it was the movement of my hand which directly caused the dislocation of
the object, i.e. in my immersion, I overlook the intricate mechanism of
computerized coordination, homologous to the role of god guaranteeing
the coordination between the two series in
occasionalism.[]{#part0008.xhtml#a1GM}[4](#part0014.xhtml#a1TZ){.class_s1fz}

of fake participation is an appropriate metaphor of the participation of
individuals in our "postmodern" political process. And this is

Occasionalism also enables us to throw new light on the exact status of
the Fall: Adam was brought to ruin and banished from Paradise not
because he was simply led astray by Eve's sensuality; the point is
rather that he made a philosophical mistake and "regressed" from
occasionalism to vulgar sensual empiricism according to which material
objects directly, without the mediation of the big Other (God), affect
our senses -- the Fall is primarily a question of Adam's philosophical
convictions. That is to say, prior to the Fall, Adam fully mastered his
body and maintained a distance from it: since he was well aware that the
connection between his soul and his body was contingent and only
occasional, he was at any moment able to suspend it, to cut himself off
and to feel neither pain nor pleasure. Pain and pleasure were not ends
in themselves; []{#part0008.xhtml#page_53}they served only to provide
information about what was bad or good for the survival of his body. The
"Fall" occurred the moment Adam excessively (i.e., beyond the scope
needed to provide the information necessary for survival in his natural
environs) yielded to his senses, the moment his senses affected him to
such an extent that he lost his distance from them and was distracted
from pure thought. The object responsible for the Fall, of course, was
Eve: Adam fell when the view of Eve naked momentarily distracted him and
led him astray into believing that Eve in herself, directly and not only
occasionally, was the cause of his sexual pleasure. Eve is responsible
for the Fall insofar as she gives rise to the philosophical error of
sensual realism. And, as was already pointed out by Saint Augustine, the
punishment, the price Adam had to pay for his Fall, was, quite
appropriately, that he was no longer able to master fully his body --
the erection of his phallus escaped his control.

All the main ingredients of posthumanism are here: the passage to
post-human stage through technological manipulation of humans; the idea
that, in this way, humans will become divine (the notion of
[bogograditel'stvo]{.class_s1fv} -- "construction of god" -- promoted by
Lunacharsky and even Gorky); the idea that, with the passage to
posthumanity, we will leave behind sexuality (as, in some versions, the
last bastion of bourgeois ideology); and, finally, the idea that, in
this post-human stage, communication through media will be replaced by a
direct link between individual minds. Andrei Platonov, who was part of
this movement, but simultaneously cast a critical eye on it, wrote a
short story "Eternal Tract" in which
:::

::: class_s2m
one of the protagonists, a scientist called Matissen, creates a device
that can transmit simple commands over a distance. The machine
translates electromagnetic waves generated in a brain into a command and
passes this command to another machine, person or even to nature ...
However, his tests result in environmental disaster and eventually, over
the course of the experiment, his
death.[]{#part0008.xhtml#a1TM}[5](#part0014.xhtml#a1MA){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
The paradox which cannot but strike the eye is that Soviet high-tech
gnosticism exploded in the (material) conditions of extreme poverty (the
Soviet Union during and after the civil war). Platonov elaborated an
entire (implicit) "ontology of poor life" to provide the
[]{#part0008.xhtml#page_54}contours of the way of life of those he calls
"less than proletarians." But what if this should not surprise us? What
if precisely the epochs of exploding poverty and chaos give rise to
utopian explosions? And what if today we witness a similar "coincidence
of the opposites," with the dreams of Singularity and the rise of
homeless refugees as the two sides of the same coin, as yet another
example of the Hegelian "infinite judgment" (link between the "lowest"
and the "highest") that defines our era? Bogdanov plays here the key
role as a full participant in the movement, but with a critical
distance, so his work deserves a closer look. What we should focus on is
the shift that occurs in his work somewhere in the late 1920s. Until
that point, he saw the material base of "poor life" in what he called
"labour of life," the incessant struggle for survival. When we are
caught in the "labour of life," we are not really alive, we are just
"involved in life!": "In the labouring being there is no time to live,
or, as the reservist Komyagin says: 'After all, I am not living. I have
only been involved in life'. It seems that many of Platonov's characters
do not live, but are only 'involved in life', i.e. struggling with the
state of poor life." Here comes the first of Bogdanov's specific pins:
"labour of life" includes sexuality which therefore brings no redemption
and remains another burden in the struggle for survival -- sexuality is
here reduced to the "labour of social reproduction":
:::

::: class_s2m
In his early essay "Proletarian Culture", Platonov writes: "Sex became
the main, central feeling in the struggle for survival, a soul of the
person. And implementation of the law of sex became the highest blessing
of the person". From this it follows that gender, biological
reproduction, sex and the nuclear family are means of immortality in
capitalist society. Opposed to the unconscious struggle for individual
survival in acts of biological reproduction, communism is the common
life of the new sexless human.
:::

::: class_s2p
If even sexuality does not indicate a way out of the labour of life,
where, then, can we locate a break or an interruption in the continuum
of laboring and production? Platonov's solution is [toská]{.class_s1fv},
a Russian word mobilized by him to designate the experience which occurs
when
:::

::: {#part0008.xhtml#page_55 .class_s2m}
the working process forms a blank space, a pause. It is literally the
emptiness, a void, which is formed by the lack of labour. This emptiness
produces a thought, whereas absolute fullness (preoccupation) with
labour does not leave a space for a pause or a gap for thinking ...
Platonov uses a specific Russian word, [toská]{.class_s1fv}, to describe
this existential state or feeling of enslavement within poor life ...
[Toská]{.class_s1fv} is close to the English terms "melancholy" and
"longing", but it has no cause, object or direction.
:::

::: class_s2p
The status of poor life is thus profoundly ambiguous: it is the lowest,
constant struggle for survival, but it also functions on the verge of
withdrawal from active life and as such opens up the space for breaking
out of the continuum of laboring and production -- in contrast to
proletarians, nomadic Others don't work, their despair cannot find
solace in productive engagement. And, again, one should not miss the
cosmic dimension of [toská]{.class_s1fv}: "But why, Nikita, do the
fields lie there so boringly? Can it be that [toská]{.class_s1fv} is
inside of the whole world -- and there's a five-year plan only in
ourselves?" [Toská]{.class_s1fv} is not just a human disposition, it
permeates entire reality, it is present even in the inertia of abandoned
fields. For this reason, one should not focus too much on the emotional
aspect of [toská]{.class_s1fv} (is it despair and melancholy? etc.): it
is rather thinking at its zero level, a pure thought as the
disconnection from the laborious life cycle:
:::

::: class_s2m
Platonov seems to juxtapose the labouring being that has no breaks, on
the one hand, and thinking as a pause that produces emptiness and a
"timeless" sense of [toská]{.class_s1fv}, on the other ... The end of
time is the end of labouring being, and [toská]{.class_s1fv} reveals the
necessity of Communism as the only means to overcome the endless time of
reproduction.
:::

::: class_s2p
In this radical politico-cosmic vision, there will be no
[toská]{.class_s1fv} in Communism, since Communism leaves behind the
very condition which gives birth to [toská]{.class_s1fv}: it is the end
of time as we know it, insofar as time is for us, for our historical
experience, time of loss and lack, of suffering and striving. As such,
Communism is a cosmic event, not just a social transformation, as
radical as it can be: everything []{#part0008.xhtml#page_56}that
exists -- including animals and plants-- must be liberated from poor
life ...[]{#part0008.xhtml#a1KR}[6](#part0014.xhtml#a1PX){.class_s1fz}
However, in the mid-1920s Platonov became disillusioned with the
viability of this cosmic-social short-circuit (a social revolution that
redeems nature itself), he
:::

::: class_s2m
criticizes the possibility of technical progress and the overcoming of
class contradictions by means of a pure form of consciousness,
concluding instead that cyclical production and reproduction,
organisation and disorganisation is the ontological precondition of all
social forms ... the environment has to be arranged in such a way as to
take into account these laws of organisation, in order to be able to
organise the social world not against, but in accordance with them.
Social life depends on the spontaneity and negativity of natural cycles.
Therefore the labouring being can only be negated, never fully
abolished. This means that Platonov does not employ the idea of
sublation (Aufheben).
:::

::: class_s2p
The term [Aufheben]{.class_s1fv} should be read here in a non-Hegelian
way: in Platonov's original vision, sexuality is to be "sublated" in the
naïve sense of actual annihilation: there will be no sexuality in the
posthuman Communism, while for Hegel, "sublation" is a negation which
maintains the key dimension of the negated phenomenon and elevates it
into a higher level (say, for Hegel, animal coupling is sublated in
human sexuality), and it is exactly such a more Hegelian sublation of
sexuality that Platonov imagines in his second phase: "the question is
to be solved not in the total abolition of sex, but in the abolition of
the laboriousness of life that forces women to function as commodities
and as birth-machines." In the exemplary work of his "mature" period,
the short novel [Soul]{.class_s1fv} (1935), although the typically
Platonovian utopian group of Others is still here -- the "nation," a
desert community of marginals who lost the will to live -- the
coordinates have totally changed. The hero is now a Stalinist educator,
schooled in Moscow; he returns to the desert to introduce the "nation"
to scientific and cultural progress and thus restore their will to live.
(Platonov, of course, remains faithful to his ambiguity: at the novel's
end; the hero has to accept that he cannot teach others anything.) This
shift is signaled by the radically changed role of sexuality: for the
Platonov of the 1920s, sexuality was the anti-utopian "dirty" power of
inertia, while here, it is []{#part0008.xhtml#page_57}rehabilitated as
the privileged path to spiritual maturity -- although he fails as the
educator, the hero finds spiritual solace in sexual love, so that it is
as if the "nation" is almost reduced to the background of the creation
of a sexual couple. Platonov comes here dangerously close to the
Hollywood formula of the production of a couple discernible even in a
late Western like [Dances With Wolves]{.class_s1fv} (Kevin Costner,
1990), the story of a US Army lieutenant, John J. Dunbar, who abandons
his unit and goes to live in wilderness in search of a more authentic
life; he joins there a Lakota tribe and falls in love with Stands With A
Fist, a white woman who has lived among them since she was kidnapped by
them as a child. The tribesmen assert that they do not see him as a
white man, but as a Sioux warrior called Dances With Wolves. But, at the
winter camp, Dunbar decides to leave with Stands With A Fist because his
continuing presence would endanger the tribe pursued by the US Army, so
that, at the end, a happy couple is created and returns to civilization
while the nomadic Lakota nation just disappears; it withdraws into an
unknown territory. The same goes even for [Awakenings]{.class_s1fv}
(Penny Marshall, 1990) where the "nation" of catatonic patients is
resuscitated to life by their doctor (Robin Williams), a shy person
afraid to ask a woman for a date. At the film's end, the doctor asks a
nurse for a date and she gladly accepts, so that the patients can return
to catatonia. It is not the patients who are truly awakened, but the
doctor himself. And, as a further proof of the link between Hollywood
and the High Stalinism, let us mention Chiaureli's infamous [The Fall of
Berlin]{.class_s1fv} (1948), the supreme case of a Stalinist war epic,
the story of the Soviet victory over Hitler's Germany. The film begins
in 1941, just prior to the German assault on the USSR; the hero, a
Stakhanovite steel worker in love with a local teacher, but too shy to
approach her directly, is awarded the Stalin prize and received by
Stalin in his datcha. In a scene which was cut after 1953 and then lost,
after the official congratulations, Stalin notices a nervous uneasiness
in the hero and asks him what is wrong. The hero confesses his love
problems to Stalin and Stalin advises him on how to win the girl's
heart: recite poetry to her, etc. Back home, the hero succeeds in
seducing the girl; however, at the very moment when he is carrying her
in his arms into the grass (to perform the sexual act, in all
probability), bombs from German planes start to
[]{#part0008.xhtml#page_58}fall all around -- it is now 22 June 1941. In
the ensuing confusion, the girl is taken prisoner by the Germans and
taken to a labor camp near Berlin, while the hero joins the Red Army,
fighting in the first lines to get back to his love. At the film's end,
when the jubilant crowd of camp prisoners liberated by the Red Army
mingles with the Russian soldiers, a plane lands on an open field
nearby; Stalin himself steps out and walks towards the crowd which
greets him passionately. At that very point, as if again mediated by
Stalin's help, the lovelorn couple is reunited: the girl notices the
hero in the crowd; before embracing him, she approaches Stalin and asks
him if she can give him a kiss ... [The Fall of Berlin]{.class_s1fv} is
effectively the story of a couple reunited: World War II serves as an
obstacle to be overcome so that the hero can reach his love, and the
role of Stalin is that of a magician and matchmaker who wisely leads the
couple to its reunion ...
:::

::: class_s2s
The insistence on the strict Hegelian meaning of sublation is here not a
point of pedantry: what the "mature" Platonov envisages is precisely a
Hegelian [Aufhebung]{.class_s1fv} of the "labour of life" which includes
sexual reproduction. In Communism also, social life will continue to
"depend on the spontaneity and negativity of natural cycles. Therefore
the labouring being can only be negated, never fully abolished." In
strict Hegelese, the "labouring being" will precisely not be directly
negated but "abolished" in the sense of sublation: it will lose its
immediate character of struggle for survival and reappear as "mediated,"
as the moment of a higher social totality which follows spiritual goals;
the same goes for sex which will become a mediated moment of
intersubjective spiritual fulfillment ...
:::

::: class_s2s
However, two problems immediately arise here. The first is that, in
capitalism, such an [Aufhebung]{.class_s1fv} already takes place: a
capitalist is not motivated in his self-reproduction by a struggle for
survival. As Marx saw clearly (see the Hegelian references of his
description of the circulation of capital), in its self-reproduction,
"capital" behaves like a Hegelian Idea, the purpose of its reproduction
is not the survival of workers but its own expanded reproduction
(measured by growing profit). Which is why the critique of capitalism as
a system of egotism totally misses the point: a true capitalist is not a
hedonist, he or she can even live a very ascetic life, sacrificing
everything, all his or her pleasures, for the smooth functioning
[]{#part0008.xhtml#page_59}of the reproduction of capital. We should
thus, as Hegel and Marx did long ago, distinguish between two "natures,"
the immediate "natural nature" (biological life) and the "second
nature," a social product which acquires a fake autonomy and dominates
individuals as their fate. And it is similar with sexuality: human
sexuality is by definition never just a means of survival
(reproduction), it is by definition always "denaturalized," imposing on
its biological foundation its own rhythm. Even if capitalism
occasionally throws millions into poverty, its logic is not that of a
"poor life" but of a life which generates poverty as the other side of
its production of excessive wealth.
:::

::: class_s2s
The second problem, crucial for us here: neuralink (Singularity) is so
unsettling for a Hegelian as well as for late Platonov and other
proponents of [Aufhebung]{.class_s1fv}, of the "mediation" of a lower
stage into the moment of a higher totality, because it does (or at least
promises to do) something which Hegel doesn't even consider. For Hegel,
all spiritual life, all actual existence of Spirit, remains rooted in
our finite bodily existence, in our material historical reality: there
is no independent realm of Spirit; Spirit only exists in human culture;
language is its medium. While neuralink also remains rooted in material
reality (digital networks, neurobiology), and while neuralink is in some
sense scientific-materialist reductionism carried to an extreme, it also
reaches the extreme at the other end: in a great leap forward, it opens
up the prospect of a direct link between minds, of a communication
without a material medium of expression. So, to put it in Hegelese
again, neuralink promises to enact its own infinite judgment in which
the lowest (material reality of neural and digital networks) and the
highest (mind) "coincide." The prospect of pure thought is thereby
opened up: a thought which will be "pure" in the precise sense of a
direct link between minds without the need for any communicational
mediation. Is this not also a version of Communism in the sense of a
space of directly shared thoughts?
:::

::: class_s2s
In mature Platonov's vision, Communism is no longer a version of
Singularity, and [toská]{.class_s1fv} remains operative in it in the
usual sense of despair at the laborious life, not in the absolute sense.
Perhaps, however, we can nonetheless read the basic situation of his
masterpiece, [The Foundation Pit]{.class_s1fv}, as a kind of negative of
the cosmic []{#part0008.xhtml#page_60}notion of Communism. What if the
foundation pit -- this gigantic hole in the earth which will never be
filled in with the new Communist building, this symbol of meaningless
expenditure of labor which plays no role in the struggle for survival or
for a better life -- is a spectacular monument to [toská]{.class_s1fv}
as the indelible condition of our lives?

The key role of [toská]{.class_s1fv} in Platonov's idea of Communism
brings us back from politics to theology, to the theological
implications of certain visions not only of the wired brain but also of
Communism. Today, this theological dimension of the wired brain is
making a spectacular return, just (as expected) deprived of the
Communist underpinning. The sublime obverse of Musk's cynical insight
"let's try to catch up with the machines so that we will not become apes
in a zoo" is the gnostic New Age reading of Singularity as not only the
new stage of post-humanity but a key cosmic event, the accomplishment of
the divine self-actualization: in Singularity, not only we, humans,
become divine, god himself becomes fully divine. Insofar as Singularity
also implies a kind of synchronicity of minds, no wonder it calls for
theosophical speculations. That is to say, when synchronicity is
debated, the obscurantist temptation is almost irresistible -- no wonder
Jung loved this
notion.[]{#part0009.xhtml#a1T1}[1](#part0014.xhtml#a1JH){.class_s1fz}
Michael Zimmerman's essay on this topic provides a concise formulation
of this hypothesis elaborated in popular terms by Ray Kurzweil:
:::

::: class_s2m
the confluence of nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, robotics, and
genetic engineering will soon produce posthuman beings that will far
surpass us in power and intelligence. Just as black holes constitute a
"singularity" from which no information can escape, posthumans will
constitute a "singularity:" whose aims and capacities lie beyond our
ken. Technological posthumanists, whether wittingly or unwittingly, draw
upon the long-standing Christian discourse of "theosis," according to
which humans are capable of being God or god-like. From St. Paul and
Luther to Hegel and Kurzweil, the idea of human self-deification plays a
[]{#part0009.xhtml#page_62}prominent role. Hegel in particular
emphasizes that God becomes wholly actualized only in the process by
which humanity achieves absolute consciousness. Kurzweil agrees that God
becomes fully actual only through historical processes that illuminate
and thus transform the entire universe. The difference is that for
Kurzweil and many other posthumanists, our offspring -- the posthumans
-- will carry out this extraordinary
process.[]{#part0009.xhtml#a1MF}[2](#part0014.xhtml#a1VN){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
Or, to quote Kurzweil himself from [The Singularity is
Near]{.class_s1fv}: "Our civilization will ... expand outward, turning
all the dumb matter and energy we encounter into sublimely intelligent
-- transcendent -- matter and energy. So in a sense, we can say that the
Singularity will ultimately infuse the universe with
spirit."[]{#part0009.xhtml#a1WA}[3](#part0014.xhtml#a1HM){.class_s1fz}
In short, as Zimmerman notes, Singularity is for Kurzweil "a turning
point in the evolutionary process that will give rise to extraordinary
beings capable of awaking the entire material universe. Such an
awakening may be viewed as actualizing a potential present from the very
beginning. By capitalizing 'Singularity', posthumanists suggest that the
event is not merely important, but numinous, that is, possessing what
amounts to a sacred dimension. Posthumanists such as Kurzweil represent
the future in ways consistent with at least some conceptions of God."
:::

::: class_s2s
Therein resides the gnostic hypothesis of transhumanists:
:::

::: class_s2m
post-humans will eventually transform the entire universe into an
all-powerful intelligence resembling in important respects the
monotheistic God. Kurzweil's God does not transcend nature, but instead
brings nature to the zenith of its intrinsic possibilities ... only
through humankind can such divine self-consciousness occur. After
positing an Other to itself in the form of nature, which is Geist
extended in space, Geist subsequently manifests itself as conscious
humankind, which then sets about to know and thus to assimilate
Otherness constituted by extended nature. Material things are "petrified
intelligence" extended in space, whereas consciousness is liquefied
intelligence unfolding through time (history). Estranged from the idea,
nature is only the corpse of the understanding. Nature is, however, only
implicitly the idea, and Schelling therefore called her a petrified
intelligence, others even a frozen intelligence, but
[]{#part0009.xhtml#page_63}God does not remain petrified and dead, the
very stones cry out and raise themselves to spirit \[Geist\].
:::

::: class_s2p
The Hegelian (or, more broadly, German Idealist) references are clearly
spelled out here, as well as the gap that separates the idea of
Singularity from the space of German Idealism. Inert material reality
gets gradually spiritualized through the process of actualizing its
spiritual immanent potentials. The first peak of this process is human
intelligence in which Spirit becomes aware of itself, returns back to
itself from its alienation/externalization in material reality. But at
this stage, Spirit remains opposed to reality; it becomes aware of
itself as individual consciousness opposed to material reality. In order
to fully actualize itself, Spirit has to overcome this opposition and
become aware of itself as the spiritual dimension, the spiritual inner
life, of entire (material) reality itself. At this level, my
self-consciousness overlaps with the self-consciousness of entire
reality itself, or, in theological terms, my awareness of god is
simultaneously the self-awareness of god himself. God is not an entity
outside the process of reality which steers it from a safe distance; the
process of reality is the process that takes place in god himself, it
overlaps with the becoming of god himself. The difference that separates
German Idealism from the theorists of Singularity is that, for German
Idealists, this full unity of Spirit and reality is already achieved in
philosophical speculation (or, in a more mystical version, in
theosophical experience): our human self-awareness plays a central role
in the cosmos itself since, in it, reality becomes aware of itself and
god becomes fully actual. For theorists of Singularity, on the contrary,
we, finite humans, cannot actualize the full unity of Spirit and reality
-- our separate individual awareness is a too strong an obstacle.
Reconciliation of reality with Spirit is achieved only when we renounce
our separated individuality and become one with the Spirit which
permeates reality itself, when our self-consciousness experiences itself
as the self-awareness of reality itself -- in short, when we enter
Singularity:
:::

::: class_s2m
The engine of history, at work "behind the backs" of historical agents,
is the imperative of the universe to make itself fully self-conscious.
For Kurzweil, Hegel was right in many ways, but
[]{#part0009.xhtml#page_64}wrong in this respect: Alpha has not become
Omega, the ultimate end has not been achieved, and Geist has not yet
become fully self-conscious. Vast Otherness remains to be awakened by
being assimilated to divine intelligence. If a profound cosmic telos
helped to generate self-conscious humankind in the first place, that
same telos may be animating those who today envision and call for a
post-human future ... the cosmos has brought itself to self-awareness
through humankind. Eventually, humans will evolve beyond themselves by
generating modes of consciousness and technology that will make possible
a cosmic self-realization that has something in common with St. Paul's
hope "that the Creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to
corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God."
:::

::: class_s2p
What we get here is another (third) version of "Hegel was too early":
first, there was the young Lukacs for whom Hegel's reconciliation was
the idealist prefiguration of the actual reconciliation of subject and
substance, the proletarian revolution through which the proletariat
appropriates the alienated historical substance; then, there was
Fukuyama for whom the ideal rational state, the conclusion of world
history in which individual freedom is reconciled with organic social
order, is not achieved (as Hegel thought) in rational monarchy but only
in contemporary liberal democracy; finally, there are the transhumanists
for whom only the prospect of Singularity opens up actual reconciliation
of Spirit and
reality.[]{#part0009.xhtml#a1KM}[4](#part0014.xhtml#a1NG){.class_s1fz}
The problem that arises here is, of course: what will happen in this
passage with us, humans?
:::

::: class_s2m
According to posthumanists, humankind cannot evolve in the ways required
to reconstruct the universe, because the organic body is too frail for
the task. Just as humankind has exterminated many species, quite
possibly including other higher primates, in the process of achieving
planetary dominance, post-humans may exterminate humankind to achieve
galactic and even cosmic dominance, all in the quest for total
selfconsciousness of a sort that we are incapable of imagining.
:::

::: class_s2p
Some posthumanists heroically endorse this disappearance as "the only
opportunity in cosmic history for self-conscious beings to
[]{#part0009.xhtml#page_65}move toward the Singularity." We lose our
bodily existence, but we can change the base of our existence from
hardware to software: we can download our consciousness into some
post-biological (digital) entity and then go on reproducing ourselves in
this way indefinitely. The question remains, of course: "Would many an
innocent flower, we might ask here, have to be trampled for Geist to
take the leap to immortal superconsciousness?" This question can also be
put in theological terms: since our Self as opposed to reality (and
separated from god) is what religion describes as the Fall, could
humankind regain its prelapsarian status by entering Singularity? Linked
to this dilemma is another one that we have already encountered: will we
retain in Singularity our individual self-awareness? Some theorists
claim that Singularity does not mean total immersion in spiritual
substance -- we remain subjects playing with substantial content. Here
is a quote from Cadell Last:
:::

::: class_s2m
I think when we think "how would Hegel read Kurzweil?" we are left
thinking that Kurzweil is kind of "Spinozan" in the sense that he
desires some "immanent union" with "physical substance" (mind bringing
the whole universe to life via advanced computation). However, in a
Hegelian lens would it not be that we should read this Kurzweilian
speculation as an "Absolute Image" (where Fichte got stuck), and instead
think how "each subject may ultimately demand the creation (out of
nothing) of their own universe"? Would that not be the best expression
of the "absolute as substance, but also as subject?". In this formula we
avoid the trap of thinking "subjectivity will merge with other subjects"
or "subjectivity will merge with the physical object"; but rather think
the way in which each subject is acting in relation to its own virtual
(conceptual)
universe?[]{#part0009.xhtml#a1TU}[5](#part0014.xhtml#a1NS){.class_s1fz}

In Freudian terms, Lasts's solution is a perverse one: instead of being
immersed in the divine Singularity, subjects make use of it, engage
playfully with it. What makes this solution interesting is that it
echoes the stance of the very last phase of Lacan's teaching. After
decades of struggle to penetrate through the Imaginary/Symbolic cobweb
of fictions to the pure Real, he conceded defeat. Adrian
Johnston[]{#part0009.xhtml#a1SZ}[6](#part0014.xhtml#a1HY){.class_s1fz}
brought out the intricacies and ambiguities of the "pessimist" turn
which occurs at the very end of Lacan's teaching and which culminates
[]{#part0009.xhtml#page_66}in his new formula of the end of
psychoanalytic treatment as identification with a symptom (not its
dissolving):
:::

::: class_s2m
Passage through a concluding experience of "subjective destitution", in
which ego-level identifications as well as points of reference such as
big Others and subjects supposed to know vacillate or vanish altogether,
indeed is an essential, punctuating moment of the Lacanian analytic
process. Nevertheless, Lacan does not consider it possible or desirable
to dwell permanently in such an analysis-terminating destitute state. He
sees it as both appropriate and inevitable that egos, big Others,
subjects supposed to know, and the like will reconstitute themselves for
the analysand in the aftermath of his/her analysis. Hopefully, the
versions of these reconstituted in the wake of and in response to
analysis will be better, more livable versions for the analysand.
:::

::: class_s2p
What we get here is some kind of "postmodern" Lacan: we can confront the
Real only in rare moments of lucidity, but this extreme experience
cannot last, we have to return to our ordinary life of dwelling in
semblances, in symbolic fictions ... And is it not the same with
Christian atheism? The obvious reproach to Badiou, me, and other
"Christian atheists" is: why do we not assert materialism directly, why
do we need a detour through religion? Christian atheists claim that we
cannot leave religion behind, that we need its mirage to transgress it
repeatedly -- or, to put it in Kantian terms, religion is not just a
historical phenomenon but a kind of transcendental illusion immanent to
the human mind. So instead of erasing god out of the picture, the only
way is to learn how to "'make use of' Dieu comme le Nom-du-Père." In
what precise sense, then, are [les non-dupes errent]{.class_s1fv} --
those who pretend not to be duped by the religious illusion -- in the
wrong? Johnston indicates the way:
:::

::: class_s2m
Lacan's paraphrase of Dostoyevsky, according to which "if God is dead,
then nothing is permitted", seems to convey the sense that permanent
radical atheism is undesirable as per the strict Lacanian definition of
desire. De Kesel claims that, for Lacan, religion enjoys the virtue of
sustaining desire. If so, does Lacan's version of analysis really seek
to do away with theism, religiosity, []{#part0009.xhtml#page_67}and the
like? ... The libidinal economy of the unconscious, centered on desire
with its fundamental fantasies involving objet petit a, is sustained by
the Law of God as the dead father and/or Name of-the-Father. If this God
dies, then the entire economy He supports collapses (i.e., "nothing is
permitted"). In [Television]{.class_s1fv}, Lacan, speaking of matters
Oedipal, remarks, "Even if the memories of familial suppression weren't
true, they would have to be invented, and that is certainly done."
Paraphrasing this remark, one might say that, by Lacan's lights, if God
is dead, then, at least for libidinal reasons, he would have to be
resurrected -- and that has certainly been done.
:::

::: class_s2p
So does "if god doesn't exist, then everything is prohibited" not mean
that, in order to sustain our desire, we need something like god (even
if it is only in its more neutral irreligious form, as subject supposed
to know)? How to combine this with Lacan's claim that atheism is the
pinnacle of psychoanalytic experience? Is Lacan's line that the
name-of-the-Father should not be abolished but made use of the only way
out? Furthermore, does something similar not hold for the (eventual)
passage into Singularity? Does this passage not imply that, in some
sense, the Symbolic will fall into the Real and thus the (human) desire
will be killed? So do we not here also confront the alternative: either
we make this passage and thus risk losing it all, or (in parallel with
the very last Lacan) we abstain from it and stick to the domain of
symbolic fictions? Should then "do not enter Singularity" be elevated
into a new version of the prohibition of incest? What this further
implies is that, far from standing for a step into the divine dimension
(as the New Age readers of Singularity claim), the passage into
Singularity would have implied its loss, the abolition of all
transcendence, the utter vulgarization/flattening of our existence?
Johnston reads Lacan's solution as an escape into perversion, into a
perverse transgressing game: you posit the big Other to violate/kill
him, with the implication that prior to his death he was
alive/full/non-barred:
:::

::: class_s2m
The paradoxical status of Christianity as the religion of atheism, a
status Lacan joins everyone from Hegel to Žižek in assigning to this
monotheism, is integral to what makes it perverse in the strictest of
senses by Lacan's reckoning. The Lacanian pervert
[]{#part0009.xhtml#page_68}plays a double game. On the one hand, he/she
registers, at least unconsciously, the signifier of the barred Other,
S([Ⱥ]{.class_s1hr}), namely, indications that there is no locus of
omniscience, omnipotence, perfection, and the like. On the other hand,
the pervert repeatedly sets about, in reaction to this registration of
S([Ⱥ]{.class_s1hr}), trying in one or more ways to plaster over the
cracks in le grand Autre (i.e., "plugging the hole in the Other"). As
the religion of atheism, Christianity simultaneously both reveals that
le grand Autre n'existe pas ("Father, why hast Thou forsaken me?", etc.)
as well as conceals this revelation through various means (denying God's
death, deifying/fetishizing Jesus as Christ-the-God, and so on).
:::

::: class_s2p
The key to this paradox is provided by a passage in Lacan's seminar
[Encore]{.class_s1fv} where he claims that the trick of the prohibition
of incest is to present immanent impossibility as the result of an
(ultimately external) prohibition -- as if, if mother were not
prohibited, it would be possible to fully enjoy
incest.[]{#part0009.xhtml#a1VG}[7](#part0014.xhtml#a1P4){.class_s1fz}
Prohibition thus gives rise to the illusory hope that, if we violate it,
we can get the Thing -- to put it simply, the fact that mother is
prohibited masks the fact that mother herself is already not THE
Mother/Thing. Heterosexual men choose women as mother's replacement to
obfuscate the fact that mother herself is not Mother.
:::

::: class_s2s
So it seems that, in his very last period, Lacan himself accepts this
game: we need fictions and illusions to survive. So, instead of pursuing
the path of trying to reach the pure Real (beyond Imaginary-Symbolic)
through formalization and/or the babble of la langue, he reasserts the
dimension of Symbolic/imaginary, its fictions and lies, as unavoidable.
That's why the focus on the Real in late Lacan is not his final word,
and we should draw "a sharp distinction between the late Lacan and the
final Lacan": the very last Lacan, in his twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth
seminars ([L'insu que sait de l'une-bévue, s'aile à mourre
\[1976--1977\]]{.class_s1fv} and [Le moment de conclure
\[1977--1978\]]{.class_s1fv}),
:::

::: class_s2m
self-critically abandons much of what he pursued during the later period
of his teaching from the 1960s through the mid-1970s ... starting in
1976, Lacan puts an end to the reign of the matheme, namely, the pursuit
of an analysis purged of meaning []{#part0009.xhtml#page_69}through
mathematical-style formalizations bearing upon a senseless Real ... the
final Lacan opts instead for an anti-reductive treatment of sense
avowedly inspired by Marxian materialism. The meanings of
Imaginary-Symbolic reality arise from, but thereafter become relatively
autonomous in relation to, a meaningless Real that itself in turn comes
to be affected and perturbed by these same
meanings.[]{#part0009.xhtml#a1PR}[8](#part0014.xhtml#a1PK){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
Johnston correctly describes the shift that occurs in the very last
Lacan; what one should add is that one should not read too much into
this ending: it is not a final triumph of Lacan's thought, but rather
the admission of a deadlock. Not a positive result -- the parallel with
historical materialism (the "non-reductionist" relationship between the
"infrastructure" of the Real and the "superstructure" of the
Imaginary-Symbolic) is rather miserable. The task remains: how to think
the cut in the Real that opens up the space for the rise of the
Imaginary-Symbolic?
:::

::: class_s2s
One should be very clear here: Lacan's final admission of failure is
also the failure of his "anti-philosophical" stance; it is the result of
his reluctance to think through the philosophical implications of his
theory. Which is why we should fearlessly return to philosophy --
concretely, to Hegel, since this same problem is also the key problem
Hegel struggles with: why is the detour through illusions necessary?
Should we explain it as a cynical playing of the Absolute with itself?
Hegel effectively sometimes formulates things in a deceiving way, as if
the absolute Idea plays a game with itself, externalizes itself and then
overcomes this externalization -- and, significantly, Hegel even uses
the term "enjoyment" here, as in the very last sentence of his
[Encyclopedia]{.class_s1fv}: "The eternal Idea, in full fruition of its
essence, eternally sets itself to work, engenders and enjoys itself as
absolute
Mind."[]{#part0009.xhtml#a1PY}[9](#part0014.xhtml#a1WD){.class_s1fz} We
fall into perversion only if we accept that that there is an Absolute
which plays (self-)transgressive games to amuse itself. Consequently,
this entire configuration has to be rejected in toto -- it relies on the
cynical reading of [les non-dupes errent]{.class_s1fv}: you have to play
the game, to be duped by it even if you know it's not true. However, the
formula [les non-dupes errent]{.class_s1fv} says something different: if
you are not duped you are wrong, not just pragmatically (we need
illusions to sustain our desire) but
[]{#part0009.xhtml#page_70}effectively, with regard to truth itself.
Just playing the game without taking it seriously is not the way out.
:::

::: class_s2s
But what then [is]{.class_s1fv} the way out? We have to accept that none
of the three solutions works: (1) we should aim at the Real and try to
leave behind illusions; (2) while knowing that illusions are just that,
we should "make use" of them to sustain our desire and avoid the
deadlock of depression; (3) we should accept the fact that all there is
is an inconsistent texture of illusions, that the ultimate illusion is
the very idea of some Real beyond illusions, and we should joyfully play
with this texture of illusions. There is a fourth solution: the Real is
not external, outside the Imaginary/Symbolic texture of fictions, it is
the immanent impossibility of this texture -- illusions circulate around
an impossible Real which has no substantial status outside the texture
of illusions. In other words, the Real is not a hard inaccessible core
of reality around which symbolic/imaginary fictions float protecting us
from the direct touch of the Real; the Real is a purely virtual (and in
this sense fictitious) point of reference around which we construct
different versions of reality. Once we fully endorse this notion of the
Real, we no longer need the cynical recourse to the cobweb of illusions
to sustain our desire: the tension that defines desire is already
operative in the "pure" Real which is not a pure chaos outside the
Symbolic but the immanent impossibility of the Symbolic. This is why
Lacan's notion of the Borromean knot that inextricably links the three
dimension of the Real, the Symbolic, and the Imaginary cannot be the
ultimate answer to the question of how reality is structured: the
Symbolic and the Imaginary are not parts of the ultimate ontological
reality. The question to be addressed here is: how the pre-human Real in
itself has to be structured so that the Symbolic and the Imaginary can
arise in it.
:::

::: class_s2s
And, again, Lacan gets caught in a deadlock not because he remained too
much within philosophy but because he didn't go far enough in
philosophical reflection: his notion of the Real remains haunted by the
naïve idea of the Real as a substantial Otherness which eludes
symbolization. Lacan failed to draw all the consequences from the fact
that the Real is absolutely inherent to the Symbolic, its immanent
deadlock/impossibility.
:::

::: class_s2s
This is why "Christian atheism" does not imply the cynical stance of
"making use" of the religious fiction, of playing with god, although
[]{#part0009.xhtml#page_71}we know it is an illusion: this is not what
Lacan means when he claims that theologists are the only true
materialists. What he claims is that the Real (in the most materialist
sense) can only be discerned in the cracks/inconsistencies of
theological edifices since it is constituted by these cracks, since it
only dwells in these cracks. There is no ironic or cynical playing here,
no game of "we are really materialists, but we will play with religious
fictions to prove our point." When Lacan says [Dieu est
inconscient]{.class_s1fv}, this is the most anti-Jungian statement
imaginable. It does not mean that divinity is the domain of our profound
unconscious psychic archetypes; insofar as Lacan abbreviates
"inconscient" as "ics," which also evokes "[inconsistant]{.class_s1fv},"
inconsistent, and insofar as logical inconsistence is for Lacan the
defining feature of materiality, this means that the divine
inconsistence is the only path to materialism -- "gods are of the real,"
and the Real is accessible only through the divine inconsistence. Any
"direct" materialism falls into the trap of ontology.
:::

::: class_s2s
And does the same not hold for Singularity? One can argue for the
cynical reading of Singularity: in order not to get suffocated in its
collective space of directly shared experiences, subjects will "make
use" of the illusion of our ordinary interactivity as free individuals,
and play the game of persisting in our ordinary reality as if it is the
true one. What we stumble upon here is the same ambiguity as the one
towards the end of [The Matrix]{.class_s1fv}: in the last scene of the
movie, Neo announces the liberation of humanity from the Matrix -- but
the status of this liberation is ambiguous. As the result of Neo's
intervention, there is a "SYSTEM FAILURE" in the Matrix; at the same
time, Neo addresses people still caught in the Matrix as the Savior who
will teach them how to liberate themselves from the constraints of the
Matrix -- they will be able to break the physical laws, bend metals, fly
in the air ... However, the problem is that all these "miracles" are
possible only if we remain WITHIN the Virtual Reality sustained by the
Matrix and merely bend or change its rules: our "real" status is still
that of the slaves of the Matrix, we as it were are merely gaining
additional power to change our mental prison rules. Why does Neo not
propose exiting from the Matrix altogether and entering the ordinary
reality in which we are miserable creatures living on the destroyed
earth surface? Because, as he learned from Morpheus, this miserable
[]{#part0009.xhtml#page_72}reality is not the Real. The matrix is, of
course, a metaphor for what Lacan called the "big Other," the virtual
symbolic order, the network that structures reality for us. This
dimension of the "big Other" is that of the constitutive alienation of
the subject in the symbolic order: the big Other pulls the strings, the
subject doesn't speak, he "is spoken" by the symbolic structure. The
paradox, the "infinite judgement," of [The Matrix]{.class_s1fv} is the
co-dependence of the two aspects: the total artificiality (the
constructed nature) of reality, and the triumphant return of the body in
the sense of the ballet-like quality of slow-motion fights and defiance
of the laws of ordinary physical reality. Surprisingly, [The
Matrix]{.class_s1fv} is much more precise than one would expect with
regard to the distinction between the Real and reality: Morpheus's
famous "Welcome to the desert of the real!" does not refer to the real
world outside the Matrix, but to the purely formal digital universe of
the Matrix itself. When Morpheus confronts Neo with the image of the
ruins of Chicago, he simply says "This is the real world!", i.e., what
remained of our reality outside the Matrix after the catastrophy, while
the "desert of the real" refers to the grayness of the purely formal
digital universe which generates the false "wealth of experience" of
humans caught in the Matrix.
:::

::: class_s2s
So the solution is not destroying the big Other but Lacan's counterpart
to alienation, separation. In Lacan's terms, does separation mean what
Neo seems to preach at the end of the film, a "savoir faire," making use
of the Matrix instead of being alienated in it? Is this what Lacan
himself means by separation? No: separation means primarily the
separation of the big Other from itself, and our (subject's) location in
this gap that separates the Other from itself. As we have already seen
apropos Christianity, it means that the gap that separates us from god
is the gap that separates god from itself. Nobody -- neither we nor god
-- can enjoy here the position of a cynical manipulator; if anything,
separation means that the entire constellation is thoroughly
inconsistent and chaotic since there is no controlling agency that
secretly pulls the strings.
:::

::: class_s2s
Can the same operation be performed with regard to Singularity? Our
starting point here should be the immanent inconsistency of Singularity
itself? Why do we automatically imagine the passage
[]{#part0009.xhtml#page_73}into Singularity as our immersion in a vast
singular field? Why should it not be not a conflicting and inconsistent
domain of spaces? While it is, of course, too early to speculate about
conflicting Singularities, we should at least entertain the possibility
of inconsistent and conflicting levels of shared experiences which will
transpose the conflict between individuals into the conflict between
forms of direct collective experience. Maybe, this is how we can
overcome our alienation in the Singularity with the separation: by way
of opening ourselves up to the immanent inconsistencies and conflicts
that traverse Singularity itself. Separation is thus again not the
cynical game in which the subject, exempted from Singularity,
selectively plays with its different parts. (Recall Musk's description
of how I will be able to link or disconnect my brain from the space of
shared experiences: in contrast with this description, we should
emphasize that I will mostly not even be aware when I am immersed in
Singularity.) Separation means that, while I am still exposed to the
space of Singularity, I realize that Singularity is not a singular agent
that controls the game but an inconsistent space traversed by
inconsistencies, full of glitches.

Cantor revolutionized mathematics when he debunked the idealist myth of
a single Infinity and introduced the materialist topic of multiple
inconsistent infinities. (As a devout Catholic, he desperately tried to
undo the damage he inflicted on the religious notion of the divine
infinite One by way of imagining a non-quantitative infinite One which
would encompass the multitude of numerical infinities.) Perhaps, we
should do today a similar thing with Singularity; to debunk the notion
of one Singularity as a new form of the divine and introduce multiple
inconsistent and conflicting singularities. So instead of the grand
design of Singularity, it is much more realist to consider the
production of particular types of "posthumans" for specific tasks --
soldiers who can endure long strenuous battles are, as far as we can
tell, already "produced."

Let's return for a moment to the already-mentioned prospect of a shared
sexual experience: its perverted version would be not to do it with
somebody far away (a close friend allows me to share her/his experience
while s/he is making love), but to share the experience with my partner
while we are doing it. To immediately experience the effects of my
sexual activity onto my partner []{#part0009.xhtml#page_74}-- would this
not amount to a sexualized version of subject-object identity? This
example confronts us with the topic of sharing experiences which can be
in conflict one with another. Let's imagine a much worse case: I am a
sadist who is able to share the experience of the person I am torturing
-- will I be able to integrate this experience into my own and use it as
an additional source of my perverted pleasure ("great, I can feel how my
victim is suffering!"), or will the clash of two experiences lead to
some kind of a breakdown? This type of overlapping of multiple
experiences is similar to what quantum physics calls superposition
(which is possible only in the virtual space of quantum oscillations):
it cannot happen in our reality (in the same way that the infamous
Schrödinger's cat cannot be both alive and dead in our reality).
:::

::: class_s2s
But what if Singularity will not be modeled upon a single
self-awareness? What if it will be a fragmentary space open to a
plurality of different, inconsistent, even "contradictory" experiences?
Recall the adolescent's ambiguous stance towards his father: what if
Singularity will be able not only to contain side by side hate and love,
but to register their conflict as such? Back to our example of a shared
sexual experience with my partner, what if it will enable me to
experience one's pleasure and the other's suffering in the same way
that, in moments of intense enjoyment, I experience not only pleasure
[and]{.class_s1fv} pain but pleasure [in]{.class_s1fv} my pain? If we
are dealing with superposition of multiple experiences which cannot be
totalized into an ecstatic One, this means that there is no single
Singularity but an inconsistent texture of shared experiences which, for
structural reasons, always have to be limited -- if these limits are
stretched too far, my shared experience explodes into a nightmare. This
brings us again to the question of power: what regulatory mechanism will
decide which experiences I will share with others, and who will control
this mechanism? Two things are sure: one should discard as utopian the
idea that I myself will be able to connect/disconnect my brain, and one
should fully accept the fact that a wide all-encompassing link between
minds cannot take place at the level of subjective experience but only
at an objective level, as a complex network of machines which "read" my
mental states -- a vast "synchronous" collective experience is a
dangerous myth.

Our conclusion is thus that Singularity cannot keep its theological
promise to redeem us from the Fall: it may happen that in post-humanity
we will move into another dimension in which we will no longer be
"fallen," constrained to our finitude, but this does not mean that we
will be redeemed in the sense of reuniting ourselves with some dimension
experienced as divine. This, however, also does not mean that the topic
of theology has to be left behind -- the notion of the Fall deserves a
closer examination. We have already seen how the mature Platonov had to
concede defeat at this point, and his notion of [toská]{.class_s1fv} can
be summarized as the awareness of the Fall in the biblical sense of hard
work, bearing children ... in short, what Platonov calls laboring life
-- we all know the description from [Genesis]{.class_s1fv} 3:

Enough has been written about the paradoxes contained in these lines,
especially about the most obvious one: why did god submit Adam and Eve
to what is effectively a forced choice? Here is Stephen Greenblatt's
version of this paradox which even mentions Musk:
:::

::: class_s2m
Ancient commentators repeatedly asked why the God in the story, having
commanded Adam and Eve not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good
and evil, did not do more to prevent them from the disastrous act of
disobedience. To be sure, the Creator warned them that death would
follow any violation of his prohibition, but how could the first humans
have possibly understood what it meant to die? Why was the tree rooted
in the very midst of the garden and not locked away, the way we lock
away poison (or nuclear waste)? And how, before they had acquired
knowledge of good and evil, could humans in their Edenic innocence have
ever grasped the moral significance of what they were doing? Adam and
Eve manifestly had insufficient []{#part0010.xhtml#page_77}knowledge of
the long-term consequences of their actions, and God, who could have
implanted this knowledge in them far more easily than Elon Musk's
proposed chip, evidently chose not to do
so.[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1K6}[1](#part0014.xhtml#a1J7){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
More important for our purpose is the paradox of knowing: the serpent
tells Eve that after eating the apple from the forbidden tree,
["]{.class_s1fv}you will be like God, knowing good and evil," and, as
Hegel notices, the serpent doesn't lie -- god immediately confirms it
commenting that Adam and Eve are now "like one of us" (let's ignore here
the mysterious plural of gods). So how can eating the apple which brings
knowledge and divinity throw the first humans into the misery of mortal
life and ignorance? The standard explanation is, of course, that, by way
of imposing on them a hard choice, biased as it is, god is bestowing on
the first humans their freedom, making them aware of their
responsibility to choose between good and evil. Even the limitation of
knowledge serves this purpose: if our knowledge is perfect, if all the
details of the situation are clearly present in our mind, the choice is
easy, but what makes a moral choice hard is precisely that we have to
decide in a murky situation where the full burden of decision is upon us
... In the continuation of the quoted passage, Greenblatt provides a
succinct version of this argument:
:::

::: class_s2m
Virtually all the early interpreters agreed that the Creator did not
want to compromise the essential nature of humans by taking away their
freedom to choose, even though that freedom was the source of so much
trouble and misery. If Adam and Eve knew everything that would follow
from their actions -- if they could make the inconceivably vast
calculations that would give them, in Shakespeare's words, "the future
in the instant" -- they might have avoided their catastrophic blunder,
but it would, the Genesis story suggests, have been at the cost of their
humanity ... This is not a celebration of ignorance or fecklessness.
There was, after all, an explicit warning, however difficult it might
have been for the first humans to interpret it correctly, and the
consequences of the fateful choice were manifestly terrible. But the
Bible represents humans neither as automata -- the slaves of God -- nor
as miraculous sages, endowed with all the knowledge they need to make
the inevitably correct
decisions.[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1SJ}[2](#part0014.xhtml#a1RV){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: {#part0010.xhtml#page_78 .class_s6v}
However, the central enigma remains: in what precise way morality
(knowing the difference between good and evil and acting upon it)
implies ignorance (or, at least, a radical limitation of our knowledge)?
The philosopher who confronted this issue and provided the only
consequent answer was Kant. When Kant says that he reduced the domain of
knowledge in order to make space for religious faith, he is to be taken
quite literally, in a radically anti-Spinozist way: from the Kantian
perspective, Spinoza's position appears as a nightmarish vision of
subjects reduced to marionettes. What, exactly, does a marionette stand
for as a subjective stance? In Kant, we find the term "marionette" in a
mysterious subchapter of his [Critique of Practical Reason]{.class_s1fv}
entitled "Of the Wise Adaptation of Man's Cognitive Faculties to His
Practical Vocation," in which he endeavors to answer the question of
what would happen to us if we were to gain access to the noumenal
domain, to the [Ding an sich]{.class_s1fv}:
:::

::: class_s2m
Instead of the conflict which now the moral disposition has to wage with
inclinations and in which, after some defeats, moral strength of mind
may be gradually won, God and eternity in their awful majesty would
stand unceasingly before our eyes ... Thus most actions conforming to
the law would be done from fear, few would be done from hope, none from
duty. The moral worth of actions, on which alone the worth of the person
and even of the world depends in the eyes of supreme wisdom, would not
exist at all. The conduct of man, so long as his nature remained as it
is now, would be changed into mere mechanism, where, as in a puppet
show, everything would gesticulate well but no life would be found in
the
figures.[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1W1}[3](#part0014.xhtml#a1W2){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
So, for Kant, direct access to the noumenal domain would deprive us of
the very "spontaneity" which forms the kernel of transcendental freedom:
it would turn us into lifeless automata, or, to put it in today's terms,
into "thinking machines." And is this not ultimately presented as
achievable in the prospect of Singularity? The prospect of neuralink is
not to be dismissed as yet another "ontic" scientific research project
of no authentic philosophical interest, since it offers something
effectively new and unheard of which challenges our status of
being-human: the prospect of actual (empirical) overcoming of our
finitude/sexuality/embeddedness-in-the-symbolic. Entering
[]{#part0010.xhtml#page_79}this other dimension of Singularity becomes a
simple positive fact, not a matter of sublime inner experience. What
does this mean, for the status of our subjectivity and for our
self-experience? Can we imagine a form of self-awareness that would be
at the level of self-less floating in the space of Singularity? Insofar
as I as a singular Self no longer exist in Singularity, one possibility
is to draw a parallel between the fate of the Self in Singularity and
the Buddhist enlightenment in which the Self directly experientially
assumes his own non-being. Such an enlightened awareness is no longer
self-awareness: it is no longer I who experience myself as the agent of
my thoughts, "my" awareness is the direct awareness of a self-less
system, a self-less knowledge. However, there is a difference between
the Buddhist enlightenment and Singularity: in Singularity, I do not
acquire a distance towards my feelings and other experiences, I don't
identify with the Void that is the truth of appearances; I, on the
contrary, fully immerse myself in the shared space of feelings and other
experiences.

There is a more fundamental concern with regard to the question of the
fate of subjectivity in Singularity. The innermost core of subjectivity
resides in a unique act of what Fichte baptized "self-positing": each
subject is a point of absolute autonomy, which means that it cannot be
reduced to a moment in the network of causes and effects -- in an act of
self-relating that Hegel described as "absolute recoil," it has to
"posit" retroactively the very causes of its existence. This closed
self-referential circle of the absolute recoil in which the cause is a
retroactive effect of its effects is thus effectively a kind of
realization of the famous joke, already mentioned in Chapter 1, about
bootstrapping from the story of Baron Münchhausen who pulled himself and
the horse on which he was sitting out of a swamp in which he was
drowning by pulling himself up by his own hair. In natural reality, such
bootstrapping is, of course, impossible, a nonsensical paradox passable
only as a joke; however, it not only can happen in the domain of spirit,
it is even [the]{.class_s1fv} feature which defines spirit. The material
base of this loop of self-positing remains, of course: "there is no
spirit without matter," if we destroy the body, spirit vanishes.
However, the self-positing of spirit is not just some kind of "user's
illusion"; it has an actuality of its own, with actual effects.

It is in this sense that Lacan claims that, at the conclusion of the
analytic treatment, the subject is ready to conceive itself as [causa
sui]{.class_s1fv}, its own cause: the cause of a subject is, of course,
not an object in reality but [objet a]{.class_s1fv}, the object-cause of
desire which has no substantial reality -- it is a purely virtual X
which merely gives body to the void of desire. In our everyday life of
desire, we fetishize/reify [objet a]{.class_s1fv}, i.e., we treat it as
a real pre-existing cause of our desire; at the end of the treatment,
the subject realizes that its cause is its own (presup)position,
retroactively posited by the subject itself as its effect -- the paradox
of absolute recoil is actualized here, the circle is closed, the effect
posits its own cause. For a partisan of the so-called "materialist
theory of subjectivity" (which insists on subject as the effect of a
pre-subjective material process, a process that cannot be reduced to the
subject's self-mediation), this closure of the circle is the basic
idealist illusion of self-causation, the illusion that obfuscates the
decentered process out of which a subject emerges. However, from a
strict Lacanian-Hegelian standpoint, this self-causation is not just a
speculative/idealist illusion; it designates a cut, an interruption, in
the real itself. The subject's self-positing is "idealist" only if we
define reality as a complete texture of causes and effects, without any
gaps or cuts. This is why Nietzsche was doubly wrong in his dismissive
reference to Münchhausen in [Beyond Good and Evil]{.class_s1fv}:

What Nietzsche rejects here is the self-positing which in German
Idealism defines the subject, and it is our claim that one can interpret
this act of self-positing also in a materialist way, although the
consequences of this act are often quite paradoxical. Let's take a
recent example: it was reported in the media that Raphael Samuel, a
citizen of India, said he would sue his parents for giving birth to him.
In a wonderful display of what Anders calls Promethean shame, the shame
at being born, thrown into the world, and not self-manufactured, Samuel
is telling people, especially Indian kids, that they don't owe their
parents anything; []{#part0010.xhtml#page_81}he also claims that putting
a child through institutions like school and the job market without
their consent is wrong
...[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1R0}[5](#part0014.xhtml#a1JU){.class_s1fz} We
should not reject Samuel's complaint as ridiculous -- there is a deep
insight in it, we just have to avoid the confusion between the empirical
and the transcendental level. Empirically, I am of course "thrown into
the world," I don't choose my body, the culture in which I am educated
as a child, etc. However, to become a Self, there has to be a
transcendental act of self-positing, i.e., I have to assume my
subjectivity in a minimally active way, and the question is: can this
"absolute" act survive the immersion in Singularity? I recently read a
report on transgender individuals in a Slovene daily newspaper, whose
title reproduces exactly the same paradox: "Finally I live in a body
into which I wanted to be born" -- as if, prior to my birth, I already
had chosen my gender identity, and biological fate didn't respect my
choice ...

This notion of unconscious reflexivity also resolves the problem of the
endless regress in grounding a normative order (which rules do we obey
to ground our obeying rules?) or self-consciousness (when I am conscious
of my consciousness, am I also conscious of my being conscious of my
consciousness etc. ad infinitum). The solution is not the Fichtean one
(in the absolute I, positing and being-posited coincide, I posit myself
as positing), although it is strictly homologous to it. The solution is
that this act of self-positing, the act through which, as Lacan put it,
the subject acts as its own cause, is unconscious, always-already
presupposed by the conscious ego. Hegel called this circle of
self-positing "absolute recoil": the effects of a cause retroactively
produce their own cause. What characterizes this "materialist"
self-positing is that, in contrast to the Fichtean "idealist"
self-positing, it has the structure of a failure which can best be
illustrated by the loop of symbolic representation: a subject endeavors
to adequately represent itself, this representation fails, and the
subject [is]{.class_s1fv} the result of this failure. Recall the
already-mentioned "Hugh-Grant-paradox": the hero tries to articulate his
love to the beloved, he gets caught in stumbling and confused
repetitions, and it is this very failure to deliver his message of love
in a perfect way that bears witness to its authenticity ... Subject is
thus not just caught in the reflexivity of absolute recoil, it [is
nothing but]{.class_s1fv} this reflexivity.

The notion of such an act of unconscious self-positing is not just an
abstract rumination -- it can help us to resolve a tension in the
dominant form of LGBT+ ideology. Many observers have noticed a tension
in LGBT+ ideology between social constructivism and (some kind of
biological) determinism: if an individual biologically
identified/perceived as man experiences himself in his psychic economy a
man, it is considered a social construct; but if an individual
biologically identified/perceived as man experiences herself as woman,
this is read as an urge, not a simple arbitrary construct but a deeper
non-negotiable identity, which must be met by sex-changing surgery if
the individual demands it. Media in Slovenia reported that in a high
school in Ljubljana, a "progressive" teacher organized a trip to take
pupils to a big swimming pool and asked them there to cross-dress (boys
wearing bras, etc.). The obvious point of this experiment was to
demonstrate to the children how gender identity is not a biological fact
but a construct of social customs -- however, I find it difficult to
imagine a more ruthless and stupid experiment! Imagine among the pupils
a (biological) boy who identifies psychically as a girl: I doubt s/he
would feel relief at the fact that he can for a moment dress the way he
feels appropriate to his true identity. Would the experiment not rather
remind him of the fact that this identity is [not]{.class_s1fv} simply
the result of how he dresses etc. -- a traumatic cross-dressing (a
"girl" obliged to dress as a boy) is his/her daily life!
:::

::: class_s2s
Along the same lines, kindergartens in Norway were told that, if a small
boy is seen playing with girls, this orientation should be supported, he
should be stimulated to play with dolls, etc., so that his eventual
feminine psychic identity can articulate itself. The solution is here
rather simple: yes, psychic sexual identity is a choice, not a
biological fact, but it is not a conscious choice that the subject can
playfully repeat and transform. It is an unconscious choice which
precedes subjective constitution and which is, as such, formative of
subjectivity, which means that the change of this choice entails the
radical transformation of the bearer of the choice. In short, this
choice is a case of the unconscious act of self-positing.

"Fall" is the theological name for such an unconscious choice, and
"Fall" designates the wound (of separation, of the constitutive loss)
which characterizes our being-human as finite and sexed.
[]{#part0010.xhtml#page_83}Musk (and other proponents of neuralink)
wants to heal the wound literally: to fill in the gap, to have man
united with God by way of making him god-like, i.e., by way of providing
him with properties and capacities which we (until now) experienced as
"divine." What makes this option properly traumatic is that it turns
around the gap that separates our ordinary daily experience from sublime
speculations about our proximity to god. When someone talks about
experiencing a unity with god, a realist tells him to calm down: "Don't
get lost in your dreams, remember that you are still rooted in this
miserable earthly reality!" But with the prospect of Singularity, the
reply to this "realist" view is easy: "We are the true realists, we can
provide divine immortality in our empirical reality, and it is you who
still believes that our material mortality is the ultimate horizon of
our being that I effectively dreaming -- you cling to the old notion of
reality, ignoring the big breakthrough!"

::: class_s2s
Our wager is that here, at this point where Fichte and Hegel seem
totally out of date and out of touch with our contemporaneity, we have
to return to the two of them, more precisely: to Hegel's reading of the
Fall, if we want to move beyond mere fascination at the prospect of
Singularity and really think what is going on here. As we have already
seen, (some) proponents of Singularity read it in a Hegelian way, as the
final reconciliation between Mind and Reality, as the healing of the
wound of the Fall. However, such a reading is totally incompatible with
Hegel's interpretation of the Fall. According to the standard reading of
Paul, god gave Law to men in order to make them conscious of their sin,
even to make them sin all the more, and thus make them aware of their
need for salvation which can occur only through divine grace -- however,
does this reading not involve a strange perverse notion of god? The only
way to avoid such a perverse reading is to insist on the absolute
identity of the two gestures: god does not [first]{.class_s1fv} push us
into Sin in order to create the need for Salvation, and
[then]{.class_s1fv} offer himself as the redeemer from the trouble into
which he got us in the first place; it is not that the Fall is followed
by redemption: the Fall is identical to redemption, it is "in itself"
already redemption. That is to say, what [is]{.class_s1fv} "redemption"?
The explosion of freedom, the breaking out of the natural enchainment --
and this, precisely, is what happens in the Fall. One should bear in
mind here the central tension of the
[]{#part0010.xhtml#page_84}Christian notion of the Fall: the Fall
("regression" to the natural state, enslavement to passions) is [stricto
sensu]{.class_s1fv} identical with the dimension [from
which]{.class_s1fv} we fall, i.e. it is the very movement of the Fall
that creates, opens up, what is lost in it.
:::

::: class_s2s
We all know Wagner's motif [Die Wunde schliesst der Speer nur der Sie
schlug]{.class_s1fv} from the finale of his Parsifal. Hegel says the
same thing, although with the accent shifted in the opposite direction:
the Spirit is itself the wound it tries to heal, i.e., the wound is
self-inflicted. That is to say, what is "Spirit" at its most elementary?
The "wound" of nature: subject is the immense -- absolute -- power of
negativity, of introducing a gap/cut into the given-immediate
substantial unity, the power of differentiating, of "abstracting," of
tearing apart and treating as self-standing what in reality is part of
an organic unity. This is why the notion of the "self-alienation" of
Spirit (of Spirit losing itself in its otherness, in its
objectivization, in its result) is more paradoxical than it may appear:
it should be read together with Hegel's assertion of the thoroughly
non-substantial character of Spirit: there is no [res
cogitans]{.class_s1fv}, no thing which (as its property) also thinks,
spirit is nothing but the process of overcoming natural immediacy, of
the cultivation of this immediacy, of withdrawing-into-itself or "taking
off" from it, of -- why not -- alienating itself from it. The paradox is
thus that there is no Self that precedes the Spirit's "self-alienation":
the very process of alienation creates/generates the "Self" from which
Spirit is alienated and to which it then returns. (Hegel here turns
around the standard notion that a failed version of X presupposes this X
as their norm (measure): X is created, its space is outlined, only
through repetitive failures to reach it.) Spirit's self-alienation is
the same as, fully coincides with, its alienation from its Other
(nature), because it constitutes itself through its "return-to-itself"
from its immersion in natural Otherness. In other words, Spirit's
return-to-itself creates the very dimension to which it returns. (This
holds for all "returns to origins": when, from nineteenth century
onwards, new nation-states were constituting themselves in Central and
Eastern Europe, their discovery and return to "old ethnic roots"
generated these roots.) What this means is that the "negation of
negation," the "return-to-oneself" from alienation, does not occur where
it seems to: in the "negation of negation," Spirit's negativity is not
relativized, []{#part0010.xhtml#page_85}subsumed under an encompassing
positivity; it is, on the contrary, the "simple negation" which remains
attached to the presupposed positivity it negated, the presupposed
Otherness from which it alienates itself, and the "negation of negation"
is nothing but the negation of the substantial character of this
Otherness itself, the full acceptance of the abyss of Spirit's
self-relating which retroactively posits all its presuppositions. In
other words, once we are in negativity, we never quit it and regain the
lost innocence of Origins; it is, on the contrary, only in "negation of
negation" that the Origins are truly lost, that their very loss is lost,
that they are deprived of the substantial status of that which was lost.
The Spirit heals its wound not by directly healing it, but by getting
rid of the very full and sane Body into which the wound was cut. It is
in this precise sense that, according to Hegel, "the wounds of the
Spirit heal, and leave no scars
behind":[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1KB}[6](#part0014.xhtml#a1SW){.class_s1fz}
Hegel's point is not that the Spirit heals its wounds so perfectly that,
in a magic gesture of retroactive sublation, even their scars disappear;
the point is rather that, in the course of a dialectical process, a
shift of perspective occurs which makes the wound itself appear as its
opposite -- the wound itself is its own healing when perceived from
another standpoint. At its sharpest, this coincidence of the opposites
appears apropos self-consciousness, i.e., subject as thinking:
:::

::: class_s2m
Abstractly, being evil means singularizing myself in a way that cuts me
off from the universal (which is the rational, the laws, the
determinations of spirit). But along with this separation there arises
being-for-itself and for the first time the universally spiritual, laws
-- what ought to be. So it is not the case that rational consideration
has an external relationship to evil: it is itself what is
evil.[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1UX}[7](#part0014.xhtml#a1TG){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
And this brings us to [Genesis]{.class_s1fv}: does the story of the Fall
not say exactly the same thing? The serpent promises Adam and Eve that,
by eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, [they]{.class_s1fv} will
become like god; and after the two do it, god says: "Behold, Adam has
become like one of us."([Genesis]{.class_s1fv} 3:22) Hegel's comment is:
"So the serpent did not lie, for God confirms what it said." Then he
goes on to reject the claim that what god says is meant with irony:
"Cognition is the principle of spirituality, and this ... is also the
principle by which []{#part0010.xhtml#page_86}the injury of the
separation is healed. It is in this principle of cognition that the
principle of 'divinity' is also
posited."[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1UC}[8](#part0014.xhtml#a1KX){.class_s1fz}
It is crucial to follow here Hegel's entire line of argumentation and,
not to miss the audacity of his point, to read this passage together
with the one in which he asserts that subjective knowledge is not just
the possibility to choose evil or good, "it is the consideration or the
cognition that makes people evil, so that consideration and cognition
themselves are what is evil, and that therefore such cognition is what
ought not to exist because it is the source of
evil."[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1PS}[9](#part0014.xhtml#a1KY){.class_s1fz} In
short, what makes us divine is our very fall (into Evil) since thinking
is both at the same time, evil and reconciliation. Hegel is clear here:
thinking not only opens up the choice between Good and Evil, thinking as
such is evil since the reflexivity that it implies makes it operate at a
distance from immediate substantial unity -- when we think, we abstract,
we tear up the unity of the object of thought. Simultaneously, this
reflexive distance implied in thinking implies freedom (in our thoughts
we are free -- formally, at least).
:::

::: class_s2s
This is how one should understand Hegel's dictum from his
[Phenomenology]{.class_s1fv} that Evil is the gaze itself which
perceives Evil everywhere around it: the gaze which sees Evil excludes
itself from the social Whole it criticizes, and this exclusion is the
formal characteristics of Evil. And Hegel's point is that the Good
emerges as a possibility and duty only through this
primordial/constitutive choice of Evil: we experience the Good when,
after choosing Evil, we become aware of the utter inadequacy of our
situation.
:::

::: class_s2s
Pathbreaking as it is, one should say that Hegel's reading of
[Genesis]{.class_s1fv} is too short at two (connected) topics, and the
reason is not that Hegel was too much a prisoner of his time to see the
dimension he misses -- much more paradoxically, in both cases, Hegel is
here not Hegelian enough, he fails to make here a properly Hegelian
twist. First, when he characterizes an evil person, Hegel reduces evil
to the moment of particularity in its opposition to universality
(natural egotism, selfish behavior ...). This is why, as Hegel points
out, every consistent figure of Evil has to display some features of
Goodness. As one would expect, Hegel mentions the Devil in Milton's
[Paradise Lost]{.class_s1fv} who is obviously a figure of great personal
power, pursuing a project that he experiences as profoundly ethical ...
But was not at this point Schelling (in his [On the Essence of
[]{#part0010.xhtml#page_87}Human Freedom]{.class_s1fv}) much more
profound when he decoded in Evil a principled ("non-pathological" in
Kant's sense) stance which is as such radically spiritual? True Evil has
nothing to do with particular egotism and selfish interests but is a
positive spiritual project for which people are ready even to sacrifice
their lives (as the Nazis did in order to exterminate the Jews or
dedicated Stalinist Communists did in order to crush the Trotskyist or
kulak resistance). If Hegel were to be fully consistent with the core of
his own thought, he should even say that Good itself is nothing but
universalized Evil, an Evil which wins over others and acquires the
position of universality. Therein resides also Hegel's critique of
abstract universality: for him, the French revolutionaries were evil in
their Terror precisely because they were thoroughly principled and
ruthlessly pursued a universality which ultimately excluded all
particular content. So when particular content is not reconciled with
universality, the guilt is even more on the side of "abstract"
universality.
:::

::: class_s2s
For most of us it is difficult to fully admit even the possibility of a
radical ethical deficiency, i.e., to accept that there are really evil
people. Greta Thunberg said to the world leaders gathered at the UN
general assembly in September 2019: "But no matter how sad and angry I
am, I do not want to believe that, because if you really understood the
situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil, and
that I refuse to
believe."[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1HW}[10](#part0014.xhtml#a1G4){.class_s1fz} Maybe,
she should stop refusing to believe and simply accept that they
[are]{.class_s1fv}
evil.[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1R9}[11](#part0014.xhtml#a1G5){.class_s1fz}
Sometimes, the moment arrives when one should abandon the belief that
our opponents, misdirected as they are, remain fully human pursuing the
same goals as we all do -- what if we are dealing with real enemies,
with enemies who are genuinely evil?
:::

::: class_s2s
This brings us to the second of Hegel's limitations which is even more
important for our concern. When Hegel characterizes Evil as
[Entzweiung]{.class_s1fv}, separation, self-division of the Absolute, he
quietly ignores (in his reading of the Fall) the key fact that, when the
Absolute is opposed to the "fallen" particularity, the true guilt and
responsibility are on the side of the Absolute itself. Back to the story
of the Fall: what Hegel should have said (since it follows clearly from
the inner logic of his thought) is that in all this affair the truly
evil character is god himself who pushes the first humans into the
[]{#part0010.xhtml#page_88}Fall, and what makes things even worse is
that, instead of doing it openly, he as it were washes his hands and
presents the Fall as the consequence of a "free" human decision ... This
is why Christianity culminates in crucifixion, a scene in which the
[Entzweiung]{.class_s1fv} (which for Hegel formally defines Evil) is
directly and explicitly transposed from the split between god and humans
into god himself who (with the terrifying utterance of "My God, my God,
why have you forsaken me") is split from himself? The category to be
used apropos this displacement of the gap that separates us from god to
a gap that separates god from himself is disparity, a term which occurs
three times in a key passage from the Foreword to Hegel's [Phenomenology
of Spirit]{.class_s1fv} where he provides the most concise explanation
of what it means to conceive Substance also as Subject:
:::

::: class_s2m
The disparity which exists in consciousness between the "I" and the
substance which is its object is the distinction between them, the
negative in general. This can be regarded as the defect of both, though
it is their soul, or that which moves them. That is why some of the
ancients conceived the void as the principle of motion, for they rightly
saw the moving principle as the negative, though they did not as yet
grasp that the negative is the self. Now, although this negative appears
at first as a disparity between the "I" and its object, it is just as
much the disparity of the substance with itself. Thus what seems to
happen outside of it, to be an activity directed against it, is really
its own doing, and Substance shows itself to be essentially
Subject.[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1PW}[12](#part0014.xhtml#a1VB){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
Crucial is the final reversal: the disparity between subject and
substance is simultaneously the disparity of the substance with itself
-- or, to put it in Lacan's terms, disparity means that the lack of the
subject is simultaneously the lack in the Other: subjectivity emerges
when substance cannot achieve full identity with itself, when substance
is in itself "barred," traversed by an immanent impossibility or
antagonism. In short, the subject's epistemological ignorance, its
failure to fully grasp the opposed substantial content, simultaneously
indicates a limitation/failure/lack of the substantial content itself.
Therein also resides the key dimension of the theological revolution of
Christianity: the alienation of man from god has to be
projected/transferred back into god itself, as the
[]{#part0010.xhtml#page_89}alienation of god from itself (therein
resides the speculative content of the notion of divine
[kenosis]{.class_s1fv}) -- this is the Christian version of Hegel's
insight into how the disparity of subject and substance implies the
disparity of substance with regard to itself. This is why the unity of
man and god is enacted in Christianity in a way that fundamentally
differs from the way of pagan religions where man has to strive to
overcome his fall from god through the effort to purify his being from
material filth and elevate himself to rejoin god. In Christianity, on
the contrary, god in a way [repeats Adam and Eve's fall on
himself]{.class_s1fv}: he falls from himself, he becomes a finite mortal
human abandoned by god (in the figure of Christ and his lament on the
cross "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"), and man can only
achieve unity with god by identifying with this god, god abandoned by
itself.
:::

::: class_s2s
Again, in his reading of [Genesis]{.class_s1fv}, Hegel ignores this
aspect: he only talks about the separation of man from god, and fails to
mention that the reconciliation of god and man is also (primarily even)
the reconciliation of god [with himself]{.class_s1fv} -- it is only
through the reconciliation with humans that god truly becomes god (in
the true concrete universality of this notion), so reconciliation
between god and humanity is a key event in and for god himself ...
However, Hegel's main insight remains fully valid and pertinent: for
Hegel, we, humans, reach immortality and infinity not by way of undoing
the Fall, by way of somehow getting rid of the obstacle of our finite
bodily existence and moving to another dimension of some higher reality,
but by way of reconciling ourselves with (what appeared as) the obstacle
and accepting that this "obstacle" plays the positive role of sustaining
the space of what it appears as the obstacle to. Reconciliation is not
overcoming the obstacle, but asserting it in its positive role.
:::

::: class_s2s
At the level of political and social change, this means we should
abandon any extrapolation of a nonalienated future from present
tendencies -- such a mode of thinking (the logic of "now we are in a
critical moment of utter alienation, and the possibility is open for us
to act as agents of overcoming alienation") is utterly foreign to Hegel
who repeatedly emphasizes the retroactive nature of overcoming
alienation: we overcome alienation through realizing that we've already
overcome it. In other words, nothing "really changes" in
[]{#part0010.xhtml#page_90}overcoming alienation, we just shift our
perspective and gain the insight into how what appears as alienation is
the immanent condition of dis-alienation, is in itself already
dis-alienation. It is in this sense that, in his "small" (Encyclopedia)
[Logic]{.class_s1fv}, Hegel proposes his own version of [la vérité
surgit de la méprise]{.class_s1fv}, ambiguously asserting that "only
from this error does the truth come forth":
:::

::: class_s2m
In the sphere of the finite we can neither experience nor see that the
purpose is genuinely attained. The accomplishing of the infinite purpose
consists therefore only in sublating the illusion that it has not yet
been accomplished. The good, the absolute good, fulfills itself
eternally in the world, and the result is that it is already fulfilled
in and for itself, and does not need to wait upon us for this to happen.
This is the illusion in which we live, and at the same time it is this
illusion alone that is the activating element upon which our interest in
the world rests. It is within its own process that the Idea produces
that illusion for itself; it posits an other confronting itself, and its
action consists in sublating that illusion. Only from this error does
the truth come forth, and herein lies our reconciliation with error and
with finitude. Otherness or error, as sublated, is itself a necessary
moment of the truth, which can only be in that it makes itself into its
own
result.[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1RK}[13](#part0014.xhtml#a1MS){.class_s1fz}

In short, the ultimate deception is not to see that one already has what
one is looking for, like Christ's disciples who were awaiting his "real"
reincarnation, blind to the fact that their collective already was the
Holy Spirit, the return of the living Christ. To understand this process
of necessary illusion, we have to take a closer look at the structure of
temporality that is implied here. Let's take a (perhaps) surprising
example from the operatic universe. Towards the end of the Act 1 of
Donizetti's masterpiece [L'elisir d'amore]{.class_s1fv}, there is a
passage which exemplifies in a musical way the basic thrust of the
Hegelian [Aufhebung]{.class_s1fv} ("sublation," or retroactive
re-positioning). It is basically a trio sustained by a chorus; the love
triangle is composed of Adina, a beautiful and wealthy farm owner,
Nemorino, a simpleton who deeply loves her, and Belcore, an arrogant and
boasting sergeant who also wants to marry Adina. Upon hearing the news
that Adina is ready to marry Belcore the []{#part0010.xhtml#page_91}same
evening, Nemorino entreats her to postpone marriage, and Belcore
brutally tells him to fuck off: "Thank heaven dolt, that you are mad /
or drunk with wine. / I would have choked you, reduced to shreds / if at
this moment you were yourself. / So that I can keep my hands under
control / go away, fool, hide from me." The magic, of course, resides in
how this simple exchange is put into music: the most impressionable
phrase -- "[va via, buffone]{.class_s1fv}, [ti ascondi a

repositioned as the background of the predominant love duet.
Consequently, at the end of this trio, peace and reconciliation are
already achieved, although none of the participants knows it. What
interests us here is this strange intermediate time when (as the form
suggests) things are already decided, although the participants are
still engaged in their struggles ... Are these not moments of pure
bliss, not in the sense that there is no conflict but in the sense that
the conflict which goes on is already going on within the space of
reconciliation?

We also encounter such an intermediate time in epochs of political
turmoil. When, in Venezuela, Guaidó proclaimed himself the only
legitimate president with vast international support, and when his act
triggered a renewed wave of public protests in his support, he declared
on February 7 2019: "They (the Maduro regime) are already defeated.
Today, our only enemy is despair. Today, our only enemy is doubt. Today,
our only enemy is fear." However, although Guaidó presents the situation
as already decided, things are more complex and the situation is more
uncertain: Maduro was often already dismissed as "already dead," but so
far has been able to weather every crisis. The only way to correctly
describe the situation is thus: [if]{.class_s1fv}, at the end of the
day, Guaidó wins and Maduro's regime collapses, [then]{.class_s1fv} we
will (retroactively) be able to say that the game was over long before.
Once the collapse (contingently) happens, we can state that it already
happened and that it was necessary for it to happen. The intermediate
period thus extends between the two cuts: things are gradually changing
in reality; the existing regime is undermined, because we act under the
premise that, essentially, it is already lost, that its time is over. At
a certain point, this premise is then fully
[]{#part0010.xhtml#page_92}asserted in reality and the existing order
effectively collapses. The logic of "things change because they have
already changed and lost their substantial truth" thus has to be
supplemented by its apparent opposite: things gradually change at the
material level, and this change is subterranean, like a secret spreading
of a deadly infection; when the struggle erupts into the open, the mole
has already finished its work and the battle is de facto over. Here is
Hegel's classic description of this process apropos the struggle of
Enlightenment against traditional religious spirit: the gradual
extension of the pure insight of Enlightenment is
:::

::: class_s2m
comparable to a silent extension or the expansion, say, of a scent in
the unresisting atmosphere. It is a penetrating infection, which did not
previously make itself noticeable as something distinct from and opposed
to the indifferent medium into which it insinuates its way, and hence
cannot be averted. Only when the infection has become widespread is that
consciousness alive to it, which unconcernedly yielded to its influence
... In the condition, therefore, in which consciousness becomes aware of
pure insight, this insight is already widespread. The struggle with it
betrays the fact that the infection has done its work. The struggle is
too late; and every means taken merely makes the disease worse; for the
disease has seized the very marrow of spiritual life ... being now an
invisible and unperceived spirit, it insinuates its way through and
through the noble parts, and soon has got complete hold over all the
vitals and members of the unconscious idol; and then "some fine morning
it gives its comrade a shove with the elbow, when, bash! crash! -- and
the idol is lying on the
floor".[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1R8}[14](#part0014.xhtml#a1KU){.class_s1fz}

We all know the classic cartoon
scene:[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1JN}[15](#part0014.xhtml#a1GJ){.class_s1fz}
the cat reaches a precipice, but goes on walking, ignoring the fact that
there is no ground under its feet; it starts to fall only when it looks
down and notices the abyss. When it loses its authority, the regime is
like a cat above the precipice: in order to fall, it only has to be
reminded to look down ... But the opposite also holds: when an
authoritarian regime approaches its final crisis, its dissolution as a
rule follows two steps. Before its actual collapse, a mysterious rupture
takes place: all of a sudden people know that the game is over, they are
[]{#part0010.xhtml#page_93}simply no longer afraid. It is not only that
the regime loses its legitimacy, its exercise of power itself is
perceived as an impotent panic reaction. In [Shah of
Shahs]{.class_s1fv}, a classic account of the Khomeini revolution,
Ryszard Kapuscinski located the precise moment of this rupture: at a
Tehran crossroad, a single demonstrator refused to budge when a
policeman shouted at him to move, and the embarrassed policeman simply
withdrew; in a couple of hours, all Tehran knew about this incident, and
although there were street fights going on for weeks, everyone somehow
knew the game was
over.[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1N1}[16](#part0014.xhtml#a1GK){.class_s1fz}

(Falling in) love is characterized by the same temporal gap. In one of
Henry James's stories, the hero says about a woman close to him: "She
already loves him, she just doesn't know it yet." What we find here is a
kind of Freudian counterpart to Benjamin Libet's famous experiment about
free will: even before we consciously decide (say, to move a finger),
the appropriate neuronal processes are already underway -- which means
that our conscious decision just takes note of what is already going on
(adding its superfluous authorization to a fait accompli). With Freud,
decision is also prior to consciousness -- however, it is not a purely
objective process but an unconscious decision. Freud here rejoins
Schelling for whom also a truly free decision is unconscious, which is
why we never fall in love in the present (time): after a (usually long)
process of subterranean gestation, we all of a sudden become aware that
we (already) are in love. The Fall (into love) never happens -- at a
certain moment, it has always-already happened.

To put it in yet another way, freedom does not reside in your ability to
resist when you suffer -- that kind of resistance comes by nature.
Freedom is to begin to enjoy when you suffer. In June 2019, Greater
Manchester police arrested a 93-year-old Josie Birds although she had
committed no crime because it was her "dying wish." Her health was
failing and she wanted to be arrested for something before it was too
late, and taken to a police station so she could experience what it was
like to be on the wrong side of the
law.[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1VX}[17](#part0014.xhtml#a1JC){.class_s1fz} This
request was an act of freedom if there ever was one.
:::

::: class_s2s
And it is at this level that we can formulate the difference between
Sartre and Lacan. For Sartre, the basic free act by means of
[]{#part0010.xhtml#page_94}which a subject "chooses itself," formulates
the existential project that defines its identity, is an act of
self-consciousness. For Sartre, the Unconscious is a substantial,
reified entity, something that objectively determines me. For Lacan, on
the contrary, the primordial choice is unconscious since the Unconscious
is not a substantial determination of the subject but the most basic
level of reflexivity. In Christopher Nolan's [The Dark
Knight]{.class_s1fv}, the only figure of truth is the Joker, Batman's
opponent and its supreme villain. The goal of his terrorist attacks on
Gotham City is made clear: they will stop when Batman takes off his mask
and reveals his true identity. What, then, is the Joker who wants to
disclose the truth beneath the mask, convinced that this disclosure will
destroy the social order? He is not a man without mask, but, on the
contrary, a man fully identified with his mask, a man who
[is]{.class_s1fv} his mask -- there is nothing, no "ordinary guy,"
beneath his mask. This is why the Joker has no backstory and lacks any
clear motivation: he tells different people different stories about his
scars, mocking the idea that he should have some deep-rooted trauma that
drives him. This is why I find Todd Phillips's [Joker]{.class_s1fv}
(2019) problematic: it aims precisely at providing a kind of
socio-psychological genesis of the Joker, depicting the traumatic events
which made him the figure he is. The problem is that thousands of young
boys who grew up in ruined families and were bullied by their peers
suffered the same fate, but only one "synthesized" these circumstances
into the unique figure of the
Joker.[]{#part0010.xhtml#a1WN}[18](#part0014.xhtml#a1T4){.class_s1fz} In
other words, yes, the Joker is the result of a set of pathogenic
circumstances, but these circumstances can be described as the causes of
this unique figure only retroactively, once the Joker is already-here.
In one of the early novels about Hannibal Lecter, the claim that his
monstrosity is the result of unfortunate circumstances is rejected:
"Nothing happened [to]{.class_s1fv} him. [He]{.class_s1fv} happened."
And, again, the difference between Sartre and Lacan is that Sartre reads
this primordial choice of one's existence as the supreme act of
self-consciousness, while for Lacan, it is an act of the Unconscious par
excellence.

This unconscious reflexivity should be explored in more detail since it
is our hypothesis that it designates the very structure that may elude
the grasp of Singularity. We are thus back at the basic philosophical
question: is there a dimension of being-human
[]{#part0010.xhtml#page_95}which in principle eludes Singularity, even
if we are fully immersed in it? What could this dimension be if we
accept that our self-awareness is transparent to Singularity? For a
Freudian, the solution is to change the focus from consciousness or
awareness to the Unconscious.

::: class_s2j
What happens with our Unconscious in the case of our immersion in
Singularity? In order to approach this question properly, one should
first clarify the notion of the Unconscious. As Lacan clearly saw, the
Freudian Unconscious is not the substantial domain of Jungian archetypes
as the ultimate psychic reality of the subject's being. It belongs
neither to the order of being, nor to the order of non-being but to the
virtual space of pure potentiality which is actualized, which acquires
(social) reality, in the phenomenon of transference in the
psychoanalytic treatment. Transference in which the Unconscious is
actualized is not the analysand's projection onto his actual
relationship with the analyst of the "deeper" reality of his traumatic
fixations (I treat the analyst as if he is my father, etc.), it is not
the illusory staging of a scene whose proper place is elsewhere, in the
repressed memories from his past; it is the reality in which the
Unconscious whose status is purely virtual gets actualized -- let me
quote here [in extenso]{.class_s1fv} Gabriel Tupinamba's precise
description of the paradoxical status of the Unconscious:
:::

::: class_s2m
Lacan famously condensed Freud's definition of transference into the
affirmation that it is "the actualization \[[mise en
acte]{.class_s1fv}\] of the reality of the unconscious" -- this
statement, however, cannot be properly understood without another
remark, which further qualifies the "potency" that is actualized in the
clinical setting: "the unconscious is neither being nor non-being, but
something of the un-realized \[[non-realisé]{.class_s1fv}\]". That is to
say, yes, transference is the "rendering actual and manifest the
patient's hidden and forgotten love impulses", as Freud puts it, but
Lacan also adds that this artificial reality is not the precarious
substitute of a []{#part0011.xhtml#page_98}more consistent, albeit
hidden reality, some deep psychological typification of our
satisfaction. Instead, the actualization of the unconscious is rather
substituting something which never had any full consistent reality to
begin with: something which exists in the clinic, under its artificial
conditions, but which cannot be generalized out of that space, as if it
had an independent being. It would be wrong to say the unconscious has
no being -- for its being is actualized in transference -- and it would
be wrong to claim it has being -- for it cannot be directly ontologized,
transposed out of certain limits. Another way to approach Lacan's remark
would be to claim that the ontological status of the unconscious-form is
not that of another being -- something which is taking place at a remove
from the clinical setting -- it is rather of an other to being,
something which functions as a "negative supplement" of what is said:
speech within the clinical setting reveals some inherent invariances, a
kind of virtual supplement, which, albeit legible within those
artificial constraints, does not attest to an underlying causal
determination, independent from the space in which it actualizes itself
...
:::

::: class_sac
Rather than present it as the cause of those formations in which my
speech exceeds what I mean to say, the unconscious is "constituted by
the effects of speech on the subject", by what the contingent
associations made within the artificial confines of free association. It
is precisely because the unconscious formations are first and foremost
effects without independent causes that Lacan defines the status of the
unconscious as "unreal": not the unreality of its effects -- its
manifestations are after all insistingly legible -- but the unreality of
the cause of these effects, whose absence in the clinical setting should
not be mistaken for an external causal
principle.[]{#part0011.xhtml#a1UM}[1](#part0014.xhtml#a1VC){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
Our question is here again: can neuralink capture [this]{.class_s1fv}
mode of the Unconscious, not the Unconscious as the substantial base of
subject's being but the Unconscious as the virtual point of reference
that exists (or, rather, insists) only as the absent point of reference
of its effects, the Unconscious as the cause which doesn't precede its
effects but is only actualized in its effects and thus retroactively
caused by them? The unconscious is thus neither the original
[]{#part0011.xhtml#page_99}reality of, say, my traumatic relationship
with my father, nor the present reality of my relationship with the
analyst but a third purely virtual entity in the space between two
actual entities that are part of my reality. I experienced something
similar when I consumed the two versions of Doctorow's [Billy
Bathgate]{.class_s1fv}, the original book and the cinema version. The
movie is basically a failure, but an interesting one: a failure which
nonetheless evokes in the viewer the specter of a much better novel.
However, when one then goes on to read the novel on which the film is
based, one is disappointed -- this is [not]{.class_s1fv} the novel the
film evoked as the standard with regard to which it failed. The
repetition (of a failed novel in the failed film) thus gives rise to a
third, purely virtual, element: the better novel. This is an exemplary
case of what Deleuze describes in a crucial passage from [Difference and
Repetition]{.class_s1fv}:
:::

::: class_s2m
while it may seem that the two presents are successive, at a variable
distance apart in the series of reals, in fact they form, rather, [two
real series which coexist in relation to a virtual object of another
kind]{.class_s1fv}, one which constantly circulates and is displaced in
them ... Repetition is constituted not from one present to another, but
between the two coexistent series that these presents form in function
of the virtual object (object =
x).[]{#part0011.xhtml#a1KT}[2](#part0014.xhtml#a1KH){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
With regard to [Billy Bathgate]{.class_s1fv}, the film does not "repeat"
the novel on which it is based; rather, they both "repeat" the
unrepeatable virtual X, the "true" novel whose specter is engendered in
the passage from the actual novel to the film. This virtual point of
reference, although "unreal," is in a way more real than reality: it is
the [absolute]{.class_s1fv} point of reference of the failed real
attempts. The inexisting "better book" is what both existing works
repeat (and fail in their endeavor to repeat), it is what maintains a
distance between the two, the interruption between the two that is their
Unconscious. And, back to our topic, can the machine to which our brain
is wired capture this virtual moment which belongs neither to the order
of being, nor to the order of non-being?
:::

::: class_s2s
In Schumann's "Humoresque," we have, in the written score, the famous
"inner voice/[innere Stimme]{.class_s1fv}, a third line between the two
piano lines, higher and lower. This absent line is to be reconstructed
on the basis of the fact that the first and third levels (the right- and
[]{#part0011.xhtml#page_100}the left-hand piano lines) do not relate to
each other directly, i.e. their relationship is not that of an immediate
mirroring: in order to account for their interconnection, one is thus
compelled to (re)construct a third, "virtual" intermediate level
(melodic line) which, for structural reasons, cannot be played. Schumann
brings this procedure of absent melody to an apparently absurd
self-reference when, later in the same fragment of "Humoresque," he
repeats the same two effectively played melodic lines, yet this time the
score contains no third absent melodic line, no inner voice -- what is
absent here is the absent melody, i.e. absence itself. How are we to
play these notes when, at the level of what is effectively to be played,
they exactly repeat the previous notes? The effectively played notes are
deprived only of what is not there, of their constitutive lack, or, to
refer to the Bible, they lose even that what they never had. A true
pianist should thus have the [savoir-faire]{.class_s1fv} to play the
existing, positive, notes in such a way that one would be able to
discern the echo of the accompanying non-played "silent" virtual notes
or their absence ... which exactly fits the conscious speech in which
the virtual unconscious chain echoes. Recall Freud's "a child is being
beaten" fantasy: does this middle line of notes not meant to be played
not fit exactly the middle form of the fantasy ("my father is beating
me") which is also not meant to be experienced but just operates as a
purely virtual construct?

Let's take another example in these series, [Captive State]{.class_s1fv}
(2019, directed by Rupert Wyatt and co-written by Wyatt and Erica
Beeney), an excellent science-fiction thriller which begins in 2019 when
extraterrestrials invade the globe and Chicago is placed under martial
law. Nine years later, the world has capitulated to the invaders and
submitted to their governing authority; they are called "The
Legislators" because all subsequent laws and rules of governance come
from them. In the years after Earth's surrender, the aliens have
conscripted humans to build suitable habitats for them far underground
called Closed Zones, walled off from the rest of the city with access
only granted to high government officials. "While the new 'legislators'
remain in their underground lairs, obedient quislings in government and
law enforcement maintain tyrannical control over the populace. The
majority of humans have accepted the many apparent benefits (strong
economy, []{#part0011.xhtml#page_101}diminished unemployment, etc.) of
extraterrestrial rule. A lavish pep rally, complete with a new and
invader-stroking version of 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic', tells us
all we need to know about how easily the sheep have been
corralled."[]{#part0011.xhtml#a1NM}[3](#part0014.xhtml#a1M4){.class_s1fz}
We have to skip here many interesting features of this outstanding film
(the action mostly takes place in decrepit Chicago suburbs among poor
black boys; although events take place in the near future, reality is
strangely moved backwards in time since the legislators have prohibited
digital technology) and focus on the two levels implied by the
narrative: the film's fictional universe (yet another story about the
resistance against an alien invasion) obviously refers to our reality of
impersonal corporate rule. It is, however, wrong to see the fictional
element as simply mirroring our reality -- there is a third level
in-between the two. The aliens-rule-us dimension is not just a fictional
version of our reality, it is an immanent component of this reality
itself: do we, individuals caught up in corporate rule, not experience
it as some kind of alien force dwelling in Closed Zones and dealing with
us only through their "quislings" among us? In-between reality and
(science-)fiction, there is thus the fictional component constitutive of
our reality itself.

::: class_s2s
We encounter the same triadic structure in [The Whip Hand]{.class_s1fv}
(William Cameron Menzies, 1951), a noir masterpiece in which a rainstorm
soaks a vacationing fisherman in northern Minnesota, close to the
Canadian border. He becomes a refugee in a local town and asks for help
in getting treatment for a head injury sustained when he fell against a
rock. The townfolk refuse to be more than perfunctorily friendly (with
the exception of a superficially outgoing and jokey innkeeper superbly
played by Raymond Burr), and are continually contradicting one another.
It seems there are strange goings-on at a lodge across the lake -- there
are nocturnal visits to the lodge by a doctor, who doesn't want to talk
about it. As things turn out, Communists have already taken over the
town and turned it into a center for the study of germ warfare ... The
interest of this rather ridiculous Howard Hughes production is that it
should be read as a reflexive inversion of the standard thesis according
to which the "invasion-of-the-aliens" formula of the early 1950s (the
ordinary American who, by chance, finds himself in a small American town
gradually discovers that the town is []{#part0011.xhtml#page_102}already
controlled by the aliens) is the allegory of the Communist takeover
("aliens" stand for Communists): here, the allegory is translated back
into its "true meaning," with the easily predicted result that [the
Communist plotters themselves are haunted by the aura of
"aliens."]{.class_s1fv} This is why the meaning of a metaphor cannot be
reduced to its "true" reference: it is not enough to point out the
[reality]{.class_s1fv} to which a metaphor refers; once the metaphoric
substitution is accomplished, this reality itself is forever haunted by
the spectral [real]{.class_s1fv} of the metaphoric content. In both
cases, the third element (fiction immanent to reality itself) is the
site of the Unconscious.
:::

::: class_s2s
To further clarify this status of the Unconscious, let's recall the
famous joke from Ernst Lubitsch's [Ninotchka]{.class_s1fv}: "'Waiter! A
cup of coffee without cream, please!' 'I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream,
only milk, so can it be a coffee without milk?'" At the factual level,
coffee remains the same coffee, but what we can change is to make the
coffee without cream into a coffee without milk -- or, more simply even,
to add the implied negation and to make the plain coffee into a coffee
without milk. The difference between "plain coffee" and "coffee without
milk" is purely virtual, there is no difference in the real cup of
coffee, and exactly the same goes for the Freudian unconscious: its
status is also purely virtual, it is not a "deeper" psychic reality --
in short, unconscious is like "milk" in "coffee without milk." And
therein resides the catch: can the digital big Other which knows us
better than we know ourselves also discern the difference between "plain
coffee" and "coffee without milk"? Or is the counterfactual sphere
outside the scope of the digital big Other which is constrained to facts
in our brain and social environs that we are unaware of? The primary
conflict is thus not between my inner experience and the digital big
Other, but between the two big Others: the symbolic-virtual big Other
and the real-mechanic big Other. What a digital machine can do is
something like the following imagined example:
:::

::: class_s2m
Let's say we have a coffee machine with three buttons: "Plain coffee",
"Coffee with milk", "Coffee with cream". It records all user activities
and registers the most frequent choice of every user. Let's say I
regularly ordered "coffee with milk" every day for a month and the
machine has recorded "coffee with milk" as my
[]{#part0011.xhtml#page_103}most frequent choice. One day, I happened to
want "coffee without milk" and pressed the button "Plain coffee". It's
appropriate to call this exceptional choice "coffee without milk"
because it is defined by its extraordinary difference to my ordinary
choice "coffee with milk". Since the machine has a record of my most
frequent choice, it "knows" that this "plain coffee" is in fact "coffee
without milk" and it can even display me a message: "Interesting, you're
having your coffee without milk today!" So a machine can (at least)
discern the times that a very frequent event fails to re-occur, and it
can register this as a virtual
negativity.[]{#part0011.xhtml#a1VZ}[4](#part0014.xhtml#a1MG){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
This example, however, does not fit the precise conditions of the joke
from [Ninotchka]{.class_s1fv} -- to make this joke fit our example, the
waiter should have replied to the customer something like: "Just to make
sure, sir, you're having your coffee without cream today, not with cream
as usual?" In short, what a digital machine can do is to include a
horizon of expectation: if a subject is expected to do something (and
this expectation is based on its past repetitive acts), then its
not-doing it can be registered as a "without." What a digital machine
doesn't seem to be able to do is to register an original failure, an
original not-doing it -- a case when not doing something accompanies
from the very beginning what a subject does. But the key feature missing
in this example is the redoubling of "without" which gives rise to a
strange negation of negation: in the joke, it is not only the opposition
between milk and without milk, but the concatenation of two withouts,
without cream and without milk. (My source for the example also mentions
the case of "coffee without cream," but simply as another case, with no
link to the first one, just as a parallel case of the same structure.)
It is thus a crucial feature of the joke that, in it, because they don't
have cream in the cafeteria, the "without cream" is replaced by "without
milk" -- the (plain) coffee that the customer gets thus gives body to a
double negation, i.e., the first negation ("without cream") is itself
negated (since there is no cream there to be negated), so that the
"coffee without milk" that the customer gets is the coffee "without
without-cream" -- and this is what, arguably, the digital space cannot
evoke. With regard to the Unconscious, in it, we are dealing with a
homologous double negation: when I fantasize about something
[]{#part0011.xhtml#page_104}that doesn't exist, I fantasize about
something whose non-existence replaces the more radical non-existence of
the (incestuous) Thing itself. To paraphrase Freud's own famous example,
in an incestuous dream, its message is something like: "Sorry, but in
the space of a dream, Mother is not here even as absent, so I cannot
give you a dream without mother -- I can only give you a dream without
another woman who is not your mother..."
:::

::: class_s2s
All the nuances of experiences could well be registered by the digital
machine, but what will not be possible is to register the impossible
itself, something that doesn't exist in itself but only persists in a
shady domain of neither-being-nor-nonbeing as a virtual point of
reference. Is the real qua construct not something that doesn't exist,
that insists only as a point in a formal structure? When for example,
the subject actually experiences a series of fantasmatic formations
which interrelate as so many permutations of each other, this series is
never complete: it is always as if the actually experienced series
presents so many variations of some underlying "fundamental" fantasy
which is [never]{.class_s1fv} actually experienced by the subject. Back
to Freud's "A Child Is Being Beaten" fantasy, the two consciously
experienced fantasies presuppose and thus relate to a third one, "My
father is beating me," which was never actually experienced and can only
be retroactively reconstructed as the presupposed reference of -- or, in
this case, the intermediate term between -- the other two fantasies.
:::

::: class_s2s
But let us again play devil's advocate: if the digital machine can
reproduce the incoherent multiplicity of my experience, inclusive of the
failures and limitations inscribed into it, why couldn't it in this way
also evoke (or engender in the recipient's mind, i.e., in the mind of
the other individual with whom I share my experience) the "absentials,"
the virtual points of reference that sustain the flux of my experience?
Back to the [Ninotchka]{.class_s1fv} joke: let's say that I imagine in
my mind telling this joke, and that the digital machine reproduces my
line of thought in another's mind -- would this other also not get the
notion of "coffee without milk" as distinct from "coffee without cream"
as well as from "plain coffee"? The answer is no: the transmission of
virtual absentials would only work if we presume that, even if my brain
is wired, the thought processes of my mind remain the processes that
take place in a singular subject isolated
[]{#part0011.xhtml#page_105}from others, separated from them by what the
early Lacan called "the wall of language." The moment this wall
crumbles, the moment the effects of what the Bible calls the Fall are
undone, the virtual dimension also disappears. Imagine a seduction scene
between two subjects whose brains are wired so that the other's train of
thoughts is accessible to me: if my prospective partner can directly
experience my intention, what remains of the intricacies of seduction
games? Will the other not react with something like: "OK, I know you
desperately want to fuck me, so why are you asking me all those stupid
things about the movies I like and what I would like to have for dinner?
Can't you feel that I would never have sex with you?"
:::

::: class_s2s
The difference we are dealing with here is the difference between the
"unconscious" (neuronal, social ...) facts that determine us and the
Freudian "unconscious" whose status is purely counterfactual. In our
sexual dreams, we fantasize about the best sex we never had, not about
the best sex we ever had. And is this play with virtual absentials not
brought to extreme in the already-mentioned figure of courtly love? When
the two lovers endlessly postpone the completion of the sexual act, they
don't simply limit themselves to talk and soft preliminary forms of
interplay. Their entire activity is positively defined as the sexual
version of "coffee without cream" -- as sexual activity without the
sexual act.

What makes things even more complex here is that, in courtly love, the
status of the surplus-enjoyment changes with regard to its standard
functioning. Darian
Leader[]{#part0011.xhtml#a1M9}[5](#part0014.xhtml#a1H6){.class_s1fz}
mentioned an anecdote from his analytic work, when a patient reported to
him a slip of tongue that embarrassed him: he was taking a lady to a
restaurant in a luxury hotel, secretly planning to take her to a room
for sex after lunch; when a waiter approached them, the patient said "A
bed for two, please!" instead of "A table for two, please!" Leader
rejects the obvious "Freudian" reading (i.e., that his real wish for sex
erupted directly) and proposes the opposite: the slip of tongue should
be read as a warning not to enjoy the food too much, as a reminder that
the shared lunch is just a pretext, a Vorlust, and that the true goal is
sex. The slip of tongue was thus a desperate attempt to repress the
gnawing suspicion that even sex is not "the real thing," that something
is missing in it also. We get here the standard relationship between the
"basic" pleasure (the sexual act) and the
[]{#part0011.xhtml#page_106}detours and foreplays which add
surplus-enjoyment. In courtly love, however, the "basic" sexual activity
is reduced to the detours and foreplays, so that the "full" sexual act
itself acquires the status of an impossible and endlessly postponed
excess.

This domain of counterfactuals can only be operative if subjectivity is
here: in order to register the difference between "plain coffee" and
"coffee without milk," a subject has to be operative. Subjectivity
equals here reflexivity: when plain coffee is experienced as "coffee
without milk" (and not "coffee without cream"), the counterfactual
status of milk or cream is this coffee's purely reflexive determination,
not its actual determination.
:::

::: class_s2s
What this virtual/reflexive status of the Unconscious means is that the
Unconscious is not some primitive pre-reflexive substantial content to
be reflexively appropriated by the subject in an act of
self-consciousness (of becoming aware of its "repressed" psychic
content). "Unconscious" is the immanent structure of self-consciousness
itself: what eludes the subject's consciousness is the basic level of
its self-consciousness. To arrive at this level, the structure of
self-consciousness has to be exploded from within and, in this way,
radically distantiated from conscious self-awareness. What this means is
that, at its most radical, self-consciousness is a misnomer: it is not
self-awareness but the unconscious reflexivity with regard to some
conscious content. It is in this sense that Lacan emphasizes how desire
is always also a desire to desire -- every desire is by definition
reflexive, it includes a reflexive stance towards itself: when I say "I
desire that," it is never an external report on my immediate propensity
since it always includes its own reflexive redoubling (do I desire to
desire that?). "Unconscious" is not the content of my desire but my
reflexive stance towards it.
:::

::: class_s2s
Self-consciousness is not just a redoubled consciousness, the awareness
of the fact that I am aware of things, so that another object -- myself
-- is included in the scope of objects I am conscious of.
Self-consciousness always implies what is traditionally referred to as
the normative dimension, the dimension of subjective commitment: "The
subjective form of judgment, the 'I think' that Kant says can accompany
all our representations, and so is the emptiest of all, marks who takes
responsibility for the
judgment."[]{#part0011.xhtml#a1RC}[6](#part0014.xhtml#a1G6){.class_s1fz}
Self-consciousness means that, even in the case of a simple
[]{#part0011.xhtml#page_107}statement of a fact like "there is a tree in
front of my house," I presuppose myself as standing behind this
statement, as committed to
it.[]{#part0011.xhtml#a1HZ}[7](#part0014.xhtml#a1G7){.class_s1fz} And
Lacan's point is that exactly the same goes for our desire: desire is
never just a fact of my inner life, I can never refer to it as to a
fact, I am fully implied in it as a subject. In this precise sense, even
the most unconscious desire is always "self-conscious": I don't just
desire something as a fact, I desire (or not) to desire it. In his
ethical revolution, Kant claimed that duty itself cannot serve as an
excuse to do my duty -- one is never allowed to say: "I know this is
heavy and can be painful, but what can I do, this is my duty ..." Kant's
ethics of unconditional duty is often taken as justifying such an
attitude -- no wonder Adolf Eichmann himself referred to Kantian ethics
when he tried to justify his role in planning and executing the
Holocaust: he was just doing his duty and obeying the
[Fuhrer]{.class_s1fv}'s orders. However, the aim of Kant's emphasis on
the subject's full moral autonomy and responsibility is precisely to
prevent any such maneuver of putting the blame onto some figure of the
big Other. The standard motto of ethical rigor is: "There is no excuse
for not accomplishing one's duty!" Although Kant's well-known maxim [Du
kannst, denn du sollst!]{.class_s1fv} ("You can, because you must!")
seems to offer a new version of this motto, he implicitly complements it
with its much more uncanny inversion: "There is no excuse for
accomplishing one's duty!" The very reference to duty as the excuse to
do my duty should be rejected as hypocritical. This is why, for Lacan,
Kant is at the origin of the spiritual development which gave birth to
psychoanalysis: in psychoanalysis also, the patient is never allowed to
say "What can I do, my Unconscious determines my acts, I am not
responsible for them!" -- I am fully implied in my unconscious desires.
:::

::: class_s2s
But what has all this to do with neuralink and Singularity? We had to
describe the intricate reflexive structure of self-consciousness to
approach the key question: if we imagine the subject's immersion in
Singularity, will the digital big Other be able to capture this
reflexive dimension or not? And if not, will this mean that the
reflexive dimension of subjectivity will simply disappear, or will it
persist as something that will resist its immersion in Singularity?
Surprisingly (or not for those who know Beckett's work), Beckett's
[Unnamable]{.class_s1fv} shows us the way here.

:::

::: class_s2j
One should risk a daring hypothesis here: what if Singularity is not
(or, rather, will not be) an immersion in a collective space but an
extremely solipsistic state where each Self (reduced to its
selflessness, no longer a self as opposed to others in an
intersubjective space) will function similar to what Beckett renders in
[The Unnamable]{.class_s1fv} -- we read here Beckett with Jacques-Alain
Miller who, in his seminar of 2006--2007, describes the effort of
Lacan's last years to delineate the contours of One alone before the
Other, of a hallucination before symbolic reality, of meaningless lapses
prior to any signifying
articulation.[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1NC}[1](#part0014.xhtml#a1WC){.class_s1fz}
Lacan opposes here two axes. One is the axis of the symbolic Unconscious
where, in transference, the subject relates to an Other, where symptoms
have a (supposed) meaning and, as such, wait to be historicized,
integrated into a symbolic narrative. The other is the axis of the real
Unconscious where the subject (or, rather, the subjectless Self) is all
alone:
:::

::: class_s2m
Who is this self? -- this self that knows that it has neither tail nor
head, neither meaning nor interpretation. We have here an it that is
not, as Lacan was able to play with it, the one of the unconscious, but
an it that is a
self."[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1JY}[2](#part0014.xhtml#a1H1){.class_s1fz}
"The pivot is that here, one considers the One-all-alone. At least two
allusions from Lacan, in this text, find a way to be ordered from this
all-alone. He says: "There is no friendship there, in that space that
supports this unconscious." No friendship that can be the support of the
unconscious.[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1S2}[3](#part0014.xhtml#a1H2){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
"Friendship" stands here for the link from the one to the other, between
subjects but also between signifiers -- signification arises
[]{#part0012.xhtml#page_110}only through such "friendship" where one
signifier interprets the
other.[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1FX}[4](#part0014.xhtml#a1P1){.class_s1fz}
With the subjectless Self that is all alone, there is also speech, but
this speech functions as pre-symbolic erratic hallucination, a
hallucination without law: "The hallucination does not obey the laws of
language, either those of connection or of substitution, and it appears
as being independent of the intersubjective
game."[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1RA}[5](#part0014.xhtml#a1P2){.class_s1fz} So,
again, on the one side, we have the intersubjective game of transference
through which symptoms are decoded in their meaning and thus
historicized, integrated into the subject's life story, and, on the
other side,
:::

::: class_s2m
we have a real cut off from speech, a real which "expects nothing from
speech," and which "chatters all alone" (cause tout seul). We know now
to give its value to this all alone, which signals that we are not in
history, in hysteria, in the one and the other, but, on the contrary, on
the side of the solitary. Lacan even adds that the real appears as a
"noise in which one can hear anything and
everything".[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1VU}[6](#part0014.xhtml#a1HD){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
This difference between speech as symptom pointing towards meaning, and
speech as "chatter all alone," composed of sinthomes which just condense
[jouissance]{.class_s1fv}, does not overlap with the opposition between
hysteria and psychosis; it divides the space of psychosis itself into
paranoia (in which signifying mechanisms of retroaction are still
operative) and schizophrenia in which "the symbolic ceases making sense,
making history, where the symbolic is at the level of the noise in which
one can hear anything whatever. It is a collapse of the two dimensions:
the symbolic founders on the
real."[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1VR}[7](#part0014.xhtml#a1UG){.class_s1fz}
This is also why we are here in the domain of hallucinations: when the
symbolic "founders on the real," reality (by definition sustained by a
gap that separates the symbolic from the real) disintegrates, the
subject suffers a "loss of reality ([Realitaetsverlust]{.class_s1fv})."
:::

::: class_s2s
Can we imagine how such "chatter" looks? Here we should turn to [The
Unnamable]{.class_s1fv} as Beckett's Cartesian
meditation.[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1VJ}[8](#part0014.xhtml#a1S8){.class_s1fz}
The contrast with Descartes immediately strikes the eye: in Descartes,
the reduction to "I think," to pure flow of immanent thoughts, is a
starting point of rational insight which immediately brings us to god
and to the well-ordered structure of reality; but it is as if Beckett
remains stuck at [cogito]{.class_s1fv} as One, at its zero-level, and
persists in it []{#part0012.xhtml#page_111}without the Other who would
guarantee the rational order of the universe. This is why, in [The
Unnamable]{.class_s1fv}, we never pass to (fully constituted) reality,
the universe in which the narrator dwells is precisely that of erratic
hallucinations. Andrew
Cutrofello[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1VS}[9](#part0014.xhtml#a1S9){.class_s1fz}
suggested that Hamlet's stance of procrastination can also be formulated
in Bartleby's terms: "I would prefer not to ... revenge my father."
Could the stance of [The Unnamable]{.class_s1fv} also not be put in the
same terms? "I would prefer not to ... be or think."
:::

::: class_s2s
This link to Descartes is not just an external interpretation: Beckett's
knowledge of Descartes is well known, and a number of critics have
already remarked that [The Unnamable]{.class_s1fv} is a Cartesian
[cogito]{.class_s1fv}, if a highly unusual and unstable one, a sentient
being who finds himself in the black box of his own consciousness, and
its problem is: "how does the unnameable escape being, the pain
commensurate with being, how does he exit the labyrinth of language he
finds himself in?" Here things get complicated, because Beckett does not
just stage [cogito]{.class_s1fv}; through this staging, he
simultaneously (as a good Hegelian) brings out its inner distinctions
and tensions, which we may use as astute indications of what awaits us
in Singularity.
:::

::: class_s2s
To begin with, Beckett immediately notices that this unnamable
[cogito]{.class_s1fv} is not happily floating in its hallucinations but
is radically divided: it is not speaking, speech itself is imposed on it
from outside, it is spoken (as Lacan would have put it), dominated by an
external Other, Beckett's version of Descartes's [malin
génie]{.class_s1fv}, which manipulates my hallucinations -- or, as
Deleuze put it apropos Beckett and his use of language: "it is always an
Other who speaks, since words have not expected/waited for me and there
is no language other than the
foreign."[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1KZ}[10](#part0014.xhtml#a1RZ){.class_s1fz}
In short, the unnamable "supposes that language comes to him purely from
the other, that it passes through him and does not belong to
him."[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1RF}[11](#part0014.xhtml#a1S0){.class_s1fz} So
how does the unnamable try to find its way in this mess? Here Beckett
proposes his dialectics of speech and silence: there is no chance for
the unnamable to appropriate speech, to make it its own and fully
express itself in it. All the unnamable can hope for is "to be able to
escape the torment of talking interminably by stating (through sheer
chance) something which is required to be stated to end that
torment."[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1M3}[12](#part0014.xhtml#a1S1){.class_s1fz}
But this moment never arrives, and it always ends with
[]{#part0012.xhtml#page_112}the claim that it must go on. So "the
question remains in suspension, we are unable to think language as
either finite or infinite," and the reality remains that of an endless
erratic hallucination of (external, not my own) voices:
:::

::: class_s2m
It must not be forgotten, sometimes I forget, that all is a question of
voices. I say what I am told to say, in the hope that someday they will
weary of talking of me ... Do they believe I believe it is I who am
speaking? That's theirs too. To make me believe I have an ego all my
own, and can speak of it, as they of
theirs.[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1SD}[13](#part0014.xhtml#a1RD){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
Again, our hypothesis is that such a tension may characterize our
immersion in a Singularity. If we leave aside the further redoubling of
the unnamable into Mahood and Worm (a redoubling which echoes the gap
that [separates]{.class_s1fv} speech from silence), the dilemma that
arises here is: is speech a violent act that disturbs the peace of
violence, or is the worst violence peace itself? The silence the
unnamable desires is not just any silence: "For it is all very fine to
keep silence, but one has also to consider the kind of silence one
keeps."[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1N2}[14](#part0014.xhtml#a1MY){.class_s1fz}
The silence the unnamable desires is the seemingly irretrievable silence
that is the silence before speech, the silence before the possibility of
violence: "silence once broken will never again be
whole."[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1GT}[15](#part0014.xhtml#a1MZ){.class_s1fz}
Here, however, Beckett himself misses the point in his oft-quoted
statement: "Every word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and
nothingness." What Beckett doesn't get is that when a stain appears as
unnecessary, superfluous, it remains unavoidable -- it creates
retroactively the silence it stains/disturbs. Yes, words are by
definition inadequate, but they retroactively create the very standard
with regard to which they appear as inadequate.
:::

::: class_s2s
[The Unnamable]{.class_s1fv} has traditionally been read as a narrative
from beyond death: insofar as Beckett's three novels [Molloy, Malone
Dies]{.class_s1fv} and [The Unnamable]{.class_s1fv} comprise a trilogy,
[The Unnamable]{.class_s1fv} follows [Malone Dies]{.class_s1fv}. But it
is important to note that the beyond death here is not beyond, it
involves language, consciousness, it is tied to being and lived
experience, so it would be more adequate to locate the unnamable in the
domain between the two deaths, the domain of the living dead or the
undead. Just as the unnamable comes between silence and language, the
same and the other, the inside and the outside, it comes between life
and death:
:::

::: {#part0012.xhtml#page_113 .class_s2m}
perhaps that's what I feel, an outside and an inside and me in the
middle, perhaps that's what I am, the thing that divides the world in
two, on the one side the outside, on the other the inside, that can be
as thin as foil, I'm neither one side nor the other, I'm in the middle,
I'm the partition, I've two surfaces and no thickness, perhaps that's
what I feel, myself vibrating, I'm the tympanum, on the one hand the
mind, on the other the world, I don't belong to
either.[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1SX}[16](#part0014.xhtml#a1VE){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
The final deadlock is thus the ontological one: Beckett "leads us
through a maze of language and alludes to a threshold, but it cannot be
crossed because there is nothing with which to cross, nothing to cross."
We are taken "to the edge of the universe but there is no spear to
throw, no hand to stretch through the surface of heaven which encloses
the unnamable like a wall, no way of telling if we are facing a void or
its opposite," or, to quote Beckett himself:
:::

::: class_s2m
may not this screen which my eyes probe in vain, and see as denser air,
in reality be the enclosure wall, as compact as lead? To elucidate this
point I would need a stick or pole, and the means of plying it ... Then
I would dart it, like a javelin, straight before me and know, by the
sound made, whether that which hems me round, and blots out my world, is
the old void, or a
plenum.[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1W4}[17](#part0014.xhtml#a1KW){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
This brings us yet again to the question that perennially haunts this
book: why Hegel? Why the reference to Hegel to understand such a
singularly non-Hegelian phenomenon like Singularity? Let's take the
example of the passage from silent movies to talking movies: those who
resisted this passage saw much more clearly its implications. That is to
say, what was the effect of adding the soundtrack to the silent film?
The exact opposite of the expected "naturalization," i.e., of an even
more "realistic" imitation of reality. What took place from the very
beginning of the sound film was an uncanny voice baptized by Michel
Chion
"acousmatique":[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1NX}[18](#part0014.xhtml#a1TN){.class_s1fz}
a voice that is neither attached to an object (a person) within diegetic
reality nor simply the voice of an external commentator, but a spectral
voice which floats freely in a mysterious intermediate domain and
thereby acquires the horrifying dimension of omnipresence and
omnipotence, the voice of an []{#part0012.xhtml#page_114}invisible
Master -- from Fritz Lang's [Testament des Dr. Mabuse]{.class_s1fv} to
the "mother's voice" in Hitchcock's [Psycho]{.class_s1fv}. Those who
resisted talking movies -- from the Russian avant garde up to Charlie
Chaplin -- perceived much more clearly the uncanny dimensions of what
was going on. For almost ten years Chaplin resisted making a full sound
movie. In [City Lights]{.class_s1fv}, his first film with a soundtrack,
there are only music and some noises of objects, no speech. Then in
[Modern Times]{.class_s1fv}, there is speech, but only when it is
reproduced by a machine (radio, loudspeaker) shown on screen. Only with
[The Great Dictator]{.class_s1fv} do we get speaking actors -- but who
are they? The main agent of speech is Hynkel (Hitler) with his wild
violent shouting, first heard through loudspeakers ... Chaplin thus
clearly perceived the threatening and destabilizing dimension of the
voice which functions as a kind of spectral living dead, while the
idiotic proponents of sound cinema perceived the situation in simple
realist terms ("Fine, now that we also have sound, we can reproduce
reality in a more realist convincing way"), ignoring the gap that
appeared with sound.
:::

::: class_s2s
And something similar is going on with the prospect of Singularity:
against Kurzweil and other proponents of Singularity as harmonious
floating in a divine bliss, we should discern in it a radical split --
what split? A brief return to Beckett might be of some help here: [The
Unnamable]{.class_s1fv} is split into two (probably virtual,
hallucinated) entities, Mahood and Worm:
:::

::: class_s2m
The stories of Mahood and Worm might be said to loosely describe two
philosophical poles: Idealism and Materialism. The story of Mahood in
his jar might be read as a parable following the ideas of Beckett's
compatriot Bishop Berkeley. Beckett was later to use Berkeley's most
famous premise [esse est percipi]{.class_s1fv} as a point of departure
for his screenplay Film. To be is to be perceived: once Mahood feels
himself no longer perceived he disappears (a state of matter is reduced
to a state of mind). But this disappearance suggests that Mahood has no
self-perception, that the state of mind of this same is not his own
state of mind but that of others; Mahood stops existing because "they"
no longer believe in him, not because he no longer believes in himself.
To this extent he is like Worm: "Worm is, since we conceive him, as if
there could be no being but being conceived".
[]{#part0012.xhtml#page_115}Neither the Idealism nor the Materialism is
pure, then, but the opposition seems clear enough. At an opposite pole
to Mahood, Worm is a materialist being. His is a state of mind reduced
to a state of matter, he is pre-conscious being, a thing, a creature
that sleeps, pure matter without mind, pure matter which has mind
brutally branded upon it. Worm begins life as "pupil Mahood", a blank
slate "they" attempt to inscribe with
language.[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1WF}[19](#part0014.xhtml#a1K4){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
So, again: why will subject not disappear in Singularity? Because once
differentiality is here, once we are in its space, the very
disappearance continues to persist -- not as a positive fact but as an
absential. So if we accept that a minimal form of subjectivity survives
the immersion in Singularity, we can surmise that a subject in
Singularity will also be divided into "Mahood" (solipsist floating in
the communal space of shared thoughts) and "Worm" (the thoughtless
reality). It will never just float in it: insofar as it survives as
subject, it will remain aware of itself as (also) an inert worm-like
object (part of digital-neuronal machinery). This radical gap between
pure immanence (I am Mahood, a flow of selfless thoughts) and full
objectivization (I am Worm, part of the neuronal machine) is not just
"objective," it is immanent to subject: through this objectivization
(and being aware of it), the subject as "empty" \$ persists in its
minimal distance from Singularity. We should return here to the Soviet
techno-gnosticism which, in an exact parallel to the duality of Mahood
and Worm, saw the new post-human entity as the combination of
trans-personal awareness and "objective" distance towards one's own
body: trans-personal unity is accompanied by the radical gap between me
and my embodied existence -- I may be part of the same trans-personal
awareness, but the price I pay is that I lose my personal unity and
relate to my body as an object in the world.
:::

::: class_s2s
At this point, we can even reach back from Beckett to the beginnings of
the Western tradition, to a unique text in which the contours of
post-human subjectivity are first clearly outlined: Sophocles's [Oedipus
at Colonus]{.class_s1fv}. What if the passage from humanity to
post-humanity is the passage from [Oedipus Rex]{.class_s1fv} to [Oedipus
at Colonus]{.class_s1fv}? If the human subject is Oedipal (with all this
implies: constitution through symbolic castration, regulation of desire
[]{#part0012.xhtml#page_116}through the symbolic Law, etc.), post-human
subject is like [Oedipus at Colonus]{.class_s1fv}, "anti-Oedipus" or, as
Lacan put it, beyond Oedipus, reduced to an excremental remainder of the
signifying
chain,[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1WV}[20](#part0014.xhtml#a1N3){.class_s1fz}
the chain now embodied in the collective space of Singularity.
:::

::: class_s2s
Things are more complex than they may appear already with Oedipus before
Colonus. Many perspicuous observers have noted that, with regard to the
classic tragic structure, the Oedipus story is an exception. In the
classic structure, the hero unknowingly commits a crime, but then he
subjectivizes his act, he heroically assumes guilt for it and dies a
tragic death. Psychoanalysis can easily explain the hero's guilt for
accomplishing an act which was not his free decision but his fate
predetermined by gods (or historical necessity, as Stalinists liked to
say): the subject is guilty due to the enjoyment he finds in doing what
is imposed on him, since he gets this enjoyment as a surplus, without
being responsible for it. Take the Stalinist executioner who personally
doesn't like cruelty, but has to carry out the liquidations because
History demands it -- the "objective historical necessity" to which he
refers is constituted through his recognition of it. The same goes for a
teacher who feels obliged to cruelly punish and discipline his pupils
"for their own good," although (he claims) he doesn't like doing it: "it
is desire which supports objective necessity, fate: it is subject's
desire which confers consistency onto the big Other and its
Will."[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1NE}[21](#part0014.xhtml#a1RM){.class_s1fz} So
it is not that "you will suffer your fate if you want it or not," your
desire is constitutive of the very "objectivity" of your fate: you
desire it precisely as an "objective" fact which absolves you of the
responsibility for it.
:::

::: class_s2s
It may appear that the same holds for Oedipus: he got what he desired
(killing his father and sleeping with his mother) without knowing they
were his father and mother -- however, upon a closer look, we quickly
see that this is not what Oedipus does. As Hegel put it, guilt is the
highest honor for the tragic hero -- if we deprive him of his guilt, we
submit him to a thorough humiliation -- and Oedipus is deprived even of
this honor of guilt, which means that "he is not even allowed to
participate in his fate with his
desire."[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1U8}[22](#part0014.xhtml#a1J0){.class_s1fz}
There was no "unconscious desire" in him that pushed him to his acts,
which is why, after learning what he did, he refused to act as a tragic
hero and to assume his guilt. As Lacan put it repeatedly, in
[]{#part0012.xhtml#page_117}contrast to all of us, Oedipus is the only
one without an Oedipus complex. In the usual Oedipal scenario, we
compromise our desire by submitting ourselves to the symbolic Law,
renouncing the true (incestuous) object of desire. Oedipus at Colonus,
on the contrary, remains stubborn to the end, fully faithful to his
desire, [il n'a pas cede sur son desir]{.class_s1fv}. At Colonus, he is
not a wise old man who learns the vanity of desire, he only here accedes
to it fully.
:::

::: class_s2s
As Lacan pointed out, Oedipus doesn't have the Oedipus complex, but
Hamlet does have it, fully (witness his long confrontation with his
mother in the middle of the play). Both stories, Oedipus's and Hamlet's,
are universal myths found from Africa and Polynesia to Nordic countries,
but in Sophocles and in Shakespeare, they get a different spin. In
Sophocles's version, Oedipus answers the Sphinx's riddle and thereby
pushes it to destroy itself -- a unique "philosophical" turn of the
myth.[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1VT}[23](#part0014.xhtml#a1GF){.class_s1fz}
(Moreover, Oedipus's answer is strictly wrong in the sense of false
philosophical universality which obfuscates the singularity of truth:
the correct answer is not "man" (in general) but Oedipus himself who as
a young child crawled on all fours because he was crippled and who, as
an old blind man, had to lean on Antigone to be able to walk.) Hamlet's
myth is also universal, there are even interpretations which indicate
that it originally referred to precession in the circular movement of

our cosmos
itself.[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1TW}[24](#part0014.xhtml#a1GG){.class_s1fz}
But in premodern versions, Hamlet's revenge simply re-establishes the
harmony disturbed by the uncle's murder of the father: as in [The Lion
King]{.class_s1fv}, the son kills the uncle and takes over the throne,
and the world is thereby no longer out of joint but set straight again
-- we are firmly in the circular movement of a disturbance and its
correction. In Shakespeare, however, the deadlock remains, there is no
return to the lost balance. In a way that is homologous to Oedipus's
wrong answer to the riddle of the Sphinx, Hamlet doesn't see that the
element "out of joint" in his world is ultimately himself, the
negativity that defines his status as a subject. This is how we should
read his famous line "to be or not to be, that is the question": in an
echo of Descartes's [cogito, ergo sum]{.class_s1fv}, it should be
supplemented by "to think or not to think, that is the question." Hamlet
as a subject neither is (as a determinate object in the world), nor does
he think []{#part0012.xhtml#page_118}(determinate thoughts): all his
being resides in the fleeting and elusive moment of "I think," and all
his thinking is reduced to the bare minimum of "I am." Both easy choices
-- "to be and not to think" (like the Worm in Beckett) and "to think and
not to be" (like Mahood) -- elude him, he is a pure spectral entity
which dwells in the intermediate domain of neither living nor dead.
:::

And our question here is: how are we, as desiring pure subjects, neither
alive nor dead, caught in the passage to Singularity? For Lacan, in
contrast to neutral objective truth, analytic interpretation is like an
oracle which becomes true only with regard to its effects -- say, the
fate foretold to Oedipus's father becomes true through his efforts to
avoid it. Avoidance was thus part of the plan, which means that, when
fate is announced to a subject in a prophetic oracle, if the subject
does not want to compromise his desire he does not try to escape it, but
rather persists in it -- if Oedipus's father were to avoid attempts to
escape fate and heroically accept it, it would not have happened. Does
the same hold for the catastrophic prospects of Singularity? Could they
also actualize themselves through our very attempts to avoid them? One
thing is for sure: if Singularity is our Fate, we should heroically
accept it, but without investing our desire in it. Maybe, insofar as
Singularity is in some sense incestuous (in it, we lose our distance
from reality and others), and insofar as incest is not just prohibited
but impossible (even if I effectively sleep with my mother, I discover
that she is not [the]{.class_s1fv} Mother, the ultimate object of
desire), what we shall experience by way of immersing ourselves in
Singularity is this ultimate gap, the gap between empirical mother and
Mother-Thing. Furthermore, insofar as our emergence ("birth") as
symbolic subjects occurs through acquiring distance from reality, our
immersion in Singularity will equal the undoing of our birth -- we'll
achieve what is, as the Chorus says in Oedipus at Colonus, our best
fate:

(Incidentally, one should not refrain here from engaging in a bit of bad
taste humor: could these famous chorus lines about how the greatest luck
is not being born at all not be actualized today as the best argument
for abortion? "Do you worry about the kind of world your child will live
in? We can secure its greatest luck by aborting it
..."[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1UU}[26](#part0014.xhtml#a1M5){.class_s1fz}) If
the best thing that can happen to us is not being born in the first
place, then our being born is already a kind of failure, the failure of
being born, the failure to achieve the optimal state of not being born
at all -- it is not the lack of being which is a failed being, it is our
being itself which is our failure to achieve
non-being.[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1T7}[27](#part0014.xhtml#a1M6){.class_s1fz}
In other words, our being is immanently measured by the counterfactual
hypothesis of non-being. One should not be afraid to draw radical
ontological consequences from this reversal. According to the standard
ontological configuration, entities strive for perfection, their goal is
to actualize their potential, to become fully what they are, and the
lack of being signals the failure of a thing to fully realize its
potentials. This configuration has to be turned around: being as such
(in the sense of being a determinate entity) signals a failure,
everything that is (as a particular entity) is marked by a failure, and
the only way to achieve perfection is to immerse oneself into the void
of no-being.
:::

::: class_s2s
What we have to consider here is the fact (as well as one of the great
topics of Beckett) that one can also live as not-yet-fully-born or, to
put it in more philosophical terms, as failing to achieve one's full
identity, to become what one effectively is. The alternative that
confronts us here is: how does the couple born/not-fully-born relate to
the couple of human and post-human? Are we, humans, in some sense not
yet fully born, a fuzzy and inconsistent intermediary state of being
between animality and post-humanity (as the predominant ideology of
Singularity implies), or are we as humans in some sense fully human, and
will the passage into post-human Singularity involve some kind of
regression into a state of not-being-fully-born as human individuals?
Our reference to Beckett's [The Unnamable]{.class_s1fv}
[]{#part0012.xhtml#page_120}points in this direction: will subjectivity
that is immersed in Singularity not function as a version of the
Cartesian [cogito]{.class_s1fv} which remains stuck in solipsist
hallucinations and fails to pass over into a Self that relates to a
constituted objective reality? However, the opposite version also holds:
we exist as humans, embedded in our reality, precisely as unborn,
ontologically incomplete, i.e., precisely insofar as our human existence
is marked by a constitutive failure; and in post-humanity we get stuck
in a limbo of not-yet-being born precisely insofar as we achieve our
identity in being immersed in the shared space of Singularity.
:::

::: class_s2s
To orient ourselves in this mess, we should radically change the terrain
and risk a turn to the politico-economic dimension: is this
reduction/withdrawal to One caught into its erratic hallucinations
theorized by Miller and staged in Beckett's writing, not strictly
correlative to an anonymous system of (capitalist) social domination
embedded in the machinery of digital and neuronal control, is it not its
subjective counterpart? Miller himself gives hints in this direction
when he repeatedly varies the motif of today's capitalism as a dynamic
process which takes place in a lawless real, constantly undermining all
symbolic regulations; he quotes the famous description of the capitalist
dynamics from [The Communist Manifesto]{.class_s1fv} as the appropriate
description of the capitalist real outside law:
:::

::: class_s2m
the best description of what we are plainly experiencing now, remains
the one that Karl Marx gave in his [Communist Manifesto]{.class_s1fv} of
the revolutionary effects of the discourse of capitalism --
revolutionary effects on civilizations. I would like to read some
phrases of Marx that assist a reflection on the real: "The bourgeoisie
cannot exist without the condition of incessant revolution of the
instruments of production, and thereby of the relations of production,
and with them all social relations ... There is an incessant disturbance
of all social conditions, constant uncertainty and agitation ... All
fixed and ossified relations with their train of beliefs and ideas
venerated for centuries are swept away ..." -- the clearest expression
of the break with tradition. "All that is solid vanishes into the air,
everything sacred is profaned." I would say that capitalism and
[]{#part0012.xhtml#page_121}science combine, they have combined, to make
nature disappear. And what is left by the vanishing of nature, what is
left is that which we call the real, that is, a remainder. And, by
structure, disordered. The real is touched on all sides by the advances
of the binary capitalism-science, in a disordered way, randomly, without
being able to recuperate any idea of
harmony.[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1SV}[28](#part0014.xhtml#a1V0){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
It is against this background that one should understand Jacques-Alain
Miller's thesis: "[Il y'a un grand desordre dans le
reel]{.class_s1fv}"[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1RG}[29](#part0014.xhtml#a1U9){.class_s1fz}
("There is a great disorder in the real"). That's how Miller
characterizes the way reality appears to us in our time in which we
experience the full impact of two fundamental agents, modern science and
capitalism. Nature as the real in which everything, from stars to the
sun, always returns to its proper place, as the realm of large reliable
cycles and of stable laws regulating them, is being replaced by a
thoroughly contingent real, real outside the Law, real that is
permanently revolutionizing its own rules, real that resists any
inclusion in a totalized World (universe of meaning), which is why
Badiou characterized capitalism as the first world-less civilization.
:::

::: class_s2s
Here, however, problems arise. Miller claims that the pure lawless Real
resists symbolic grasp, so that we should always be aware that our
attempts to conceptualize it are mere semblances, defensive
elucubrations -- but what if there is still an underlying order that
generates this disorder, a matrix that provides its coordinates? This is
what also accounts for the repetitive sameness of the capitalist
dynamics: the more things change, the more they stay the same. In short,
what Miller ignores is that the obverse of the breathtaking capitalist
dynamics is a clearly recognizable order of hierarchic domination. This
holds also for our sexuality: it is chaotic, permissive, lawless, but
administered more than ever through PC rules ...
:::

::: class_s2s
And was Marx not after precisely the rules, the [laws]{.class_s1fv} of
this capitalist real? Class antagonism is not a symbolic elucubration on
the lawless real of social life but the name of the antagonism
obfuscated by ideologico-political formations. In equating capitalism
with the Real outside the Law, Miller takes capitalism as its own
ideology, ignoring Lacan who saw clearly the antagonism masked by
capitalist perversion. The vision of today's society as a
[]{#part0012.xhtml#page_122}capitalist Real outside symbolic law is a
disavowal of antagonism, in exactly the same way that the notion of the
sexual Real outside the Law is a disavowal of sexual antagonism.
:::

::: class_s2s
Miller's obsession with the Real outside the Law also leads him to
endorse all too quickly the thesis that, in our social reality, the
virtual big Other is progressively replaced by the digital reality. Does
the digital big Other simply fill in the gap of the disappearing virtual
big Other? Some Lacanians (Miller included) often advocate the idea that
today, in the era of "fake news," the big Other really no longer exists
-- but is this true? What if it exists more than ever, just in a new
form? Our big Other is no longer the public space clearly distinguished
from the obscenities of private exchanges, but the very
[public]{.class_s1fv} domain in which "fake news" circulates, in which
we exchange rumors and conspiracy
theories.[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1K2}[30](#part0014.xhtml#a1SN){.class_s1fz}
One should not lose sight of what is so surprising about the rise of the
shameless obscenity of the alt-right so well noted and analyzed by

Traditionally (or in our retroactive view of tradition, at least),
shameless obscenity worked as subversive, as an undermining of
traditional domination, as depriving the Master of his false dignity.
What we are getting today, with the exploding public obscenity, is not
the disappearance of domination, of Master figures, but its forceful
reappearance.

Donald Trump is the emblematic figure of this new type of obscene
populist Master, and the usual argumentation against him -- that his
populism (concern for the well-being of the poor ordinary people) is a
fake, that his actual politics protects the interests of the rich -- is
all too shortsighted. The followers of Trump do not act "irrationally,"
they are not victims of primitive ideological manipulations which make
them vote against their interests, they are quite rational in their own
terms: they vote for Trump because in the "patriotic" vision he is
selling, he also addresses their ordinary everyday problems -- safety,
permanent employment,
etc.[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1TD}[32](#part0014.xhtml#a1W0){.class_s1fz}
Trump is not winning just by shamelessly bombarding us with messages
that generate obscene enjoyment at how he dares to violate the
elementary norms of decency. Through all his shocking vulgarities, he is
providing his followers with a narrative which makes sense -- a very
limited and twisted sense, but nonetheless a sense which obviously does
a better job than the left-liberal narrative. His shameless obscenities
serve as signs of solidarity with so-called
[]{#part0012.xhtml#page_123}ordinary people ("you see, I am the same as
you, we are all red under our skin"), and this solidarity also signals
the point at which Trump's obscenity reaches its limit. Trump is not
thoroughly obscene: when he talks about the greatness of America, when
he dismisses his opponents as enemies of the people, etc., he intends to
be taken seriously, and his obscenities are meant to precisely emphasize
by contrast the level at which he is serious: they are meant to function
as an obscene display of his belief in the greatness of America. Ralph
Peters even went so far as to characterize this aspect of Trump's appeal
to ordinary voters in Hegelian terms of the dialectic of recognition --
Trump's message to the electorate ignored by the political establishment
is one of recognition:
:::

::: class_s2m
Donald Trump possessed the genius to grasp the craving for recognition
in a huge swathe of the electorate ignored or actively insulted by the
(previously) reigning political parties. Dismissed by the custodians of
wealth; badgered by the politically correct; and taken for granted by
those who make our laws; forgotten millions were ripe for Trump's
message -- which reduces neatly to "[You
matter!]{.class_s1fv}"[]{#part0012.xhtml#a1UT}[33](#part0014.xhtml#a1W3){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
One cannot miss the irony of this fact: after Fukuyama presented Hegel
as the philosopher of the "end of history" achieved in the
liberal-democratic capitalism as the best possible social and political
form, we get now Trump, the one who disturbed this vision of the end of
history and enacted a kind of reawakening of history (history in the
sense of violent populist struggles and even of ideological civil war,
at least), again as a kind of Hegelian ... This is why, in order to
undermine Trump, one should begin by displacing the site of his
obscenity and treat as truly obscene precisely his "serious" statements.
Trump is not truly obscene when he uses vulgar, sexist etc. terms, he is
truly obscene when he talks about America as the greatest country in the
word, when he imposes his economic measures, etc. The obscenity of his
speech masks this more basic obscenity. Once again, we could paraphrase
here the well-known Marx Brothers dictum: Trump acts and looks as a
shamelessly obscene politician, but this should not deceive us -- he
really is a shamelessly obscene politician.
:::

::: class_s2s
Such an obscene big Other thus constitutes a third domain between the
private and the public space: the private space elevated
[]{#part0012.xhtml#page_124}into the public sphere. It seems to be the
form that best fits our immersion in cyberspace, our participation in
all possible chatrooms, tweeting, instagramming, facebooking ... no
wonder Trump makes most of his decisions public through twitter.
However, we don't get here the "real Trump": the domain of public
obscenities is not that of sharing intimate experiences, it is a public
domain full of lies, hypocrisies and pure malevolence, a domain in which
we engage in a way similar to that of wearing a disgusting mask. The
standard relationship between my intimacy and the big Other of public
dignity is thus turned around: obscenities are no longer limited to
private exchanges, they explode in the public domain itself, allowing me
to dwell in the illusion that it's all just an obscene game while I
remain innocent in my intimate purity.
:::

But what happens to this obscene big Other (still a virtual-symbolic
space) when we get immersed in a Singularity in which intimate fantasies
are directly co-experienced? One thing is sure: the impact of the
(eventual) rise of Singularity will be apocalyptic -- the question is
just: what kind of apocalypse will it trigger?

Apocalypse ("uncovering" in Ancient Greek) is a disclosure or revelation
of knowledge; in religious speech, what apocalypse discloses is
something hidden, the ultimate truth we are blind to in our ordinary
lives. "The Book of Revelation" depicts apocalypse as the complete and
final destruction of the world; in the same vein, today we commonly
refer to any larger-scale catastrophic event or chain of detrimental
events to humanity or nature as "apocalyptic." Although it is easy to
imagine the apocalypse-disclosure without the apocalypse-catastrophe
(say, a religious revelation) and the apocalypse-catastrophe without the
apocalypse-disclosure (say, an earthquake destroying an entire
continent), there is an inner link between the two dimensions: when we
(think that we) confront some higher and hitherto hidden truth, this
truth is so different from our common opinions that it has to shatter
our world, and vice versa, every catastrophic event, even if purely
natural, reveals something ignored in our normal existence, brings us
face to face with an oppressed truth. In our customary daily lives, we
are not ready to confront the ultimate truth and prefer to dwell in
illusions, so that when we are compelled to face the truth, we
experience it as "apocalyptic," as the end of our world. Imagine we were
to stumble upon an irrefutable proof that we are observed by aliens --
no big catastrophe, just a tiny object discovered by chance. The impact
of such a discovery with no material consequences for our daily lives
would nonetheless seem apocalyptic, shattering the basic premises of our
feeling of sovereignty and freedom, making ridiculous most of our
spiritual assumptions.

In his essay "Apocalypse without Kingdom," Günther Anders introduced the
concept of [naked]{.class_s1fv} [apocalypse]{.class_s1fv}: "the

opening of a new, positive state of affairs (of the
'kingdom')."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1KK}[1](#part0014.xhtml#a1UE){.class_s1fz}
Anders's idea was that a nuclear catastrophe would be precisely such a
naked apocalypse: no new kingdom will arise out of it, just the
obliteration of ourselves and our world. Our question here is: what will
our entry into Singularity be? The entrance into a new higher
(post-human) kingdom, just the disappearance of humanity the way we know
it, or in some sense (but what sense?) both at the same time? It is
clear that the eventual rise of Singularity will be apocalyptic in the
complex meaning of the term: it will imply the encounter with a truth
hidden in our ordinary human existence, i.e., the entrance into a new
post-human dimension, which cannot but be experienced as catastrophic,
as the end of our world. But will we still be here to experience our
immersion in Singularity in any human sense of the term?
:::

::: class_s2s
A more general overview of how an apocalypse functions is needed here;
the best version of the paradoxes of apocalyptic reason is provided by
Jean-Pierre
Dupuy.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1HN}[2](#part0014.xhtml#a1R4){.class_s1fz}
Apropos the threat of nuclear self-destruction of humanity, Dupuy points
out its paradox: it is "an event which, if it were to occur, would make
it not only that this history no longer has any sense but that it never
had any sense since there would not be anyone to remember
it."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1VK}[3](#part0014.xhtml#a1R5){.class_s1fz} Could
we not say the same about Singularity (if we endorse its "pessimistic"
reading)? Would it not be that, in an effectively post-human era in
which our distance from external reality gets lost, our spiritual
inheritance becomes meaningless, as if it doesn't exist and,
consequently, as if it never existed. This is the question we should
focus on: will post-human Singularity be a "higher stage" of perfection
where we, post-humans, will (fondly) remember the vagaries of the "lower
stage" of humanity, or will humanity retroactively become senseless?
:::

::: class_s2s
Nothing makes the paradox of nuclear war clearer than the notion of the
so-called "preemptive strike," a nuclear attack on the enemy carried out
in order to prevent its attack on us. It is like a punishment executed
in advance, before the criminal commits his
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_127}crime, so that even if we strike first, our
act counts as second, as a reaction, "striking second
first."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1PV}[4](#part0014.xhtml#a1PB){.class_s1fz}
The basic paradox of the MAD ("mutually assured destruction") logic of
dissuasion (if both sides have enough nuclear arms to destroy the other
even if the other attacks first, then no side will attack first, knowing
well that its attack will lead to its self-destruction) is that if it
works perfectly it cancels itself, so that it is its very imperfection
(the threat that it will not work, that one side will nonetheless
trigger the bomb attack) that makes it operative. Dupuy thus
demonstrates in detail how the argumentation about nuclear dissuasion
necessarily gets caught in an antinomy of moral reason:
:::

::: class_s2m
There is no unanimous reply to the question: "Is nuclear dissuasion
efficient?"; there is no argument which does not give arms to the
contrary argument; there is no reasoning which does not assume the form
of a paradox. We have here a frustrating situation, almost a humiliation
of reason.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1W7}[5](#part0014.xhtml#a1TA){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
The Kantian echoes of this formulation are unmissable -- apropos his
antimonies of pure reason, Kant himself talks about the "euthanasia of
reason." While Kant limits these antinomies to the epistemological
domain, we should be here more Kantian than Kant himself and about the
antinomies of pure practical (ethical) reason. The paradoxes implied by
the MAD reasoning are not traces of irrationality in this reasoning,
proofs that we remain caught in the domain of irrational passions of
revenge, resentment, etc., so that this reasoning is not really purely
rational. On the contrary, these paradoxes are paradoxes,
"irrationalities," of pure logic and strategic reasoning itself,
paradoxes which necessarily emerge when the stakes are raised so high
(the disappearance of humanity). In Lacan's terms of the logic of
non-all, we have to pass from "irrationality" in the sense of the
exception to reason ("pathological" passions which continue to distort
its pure exercise) to the "irrationality" of pure reasoning itself.
:::

::: class_s2s
The root of these paradoxes is that we are not dealing here with the
ordinary time of historical progress but with what Dupuy calls the "time
of the project" whose exemplary case is the great prophetic tradition of
doomsayers who paint the dark future of total catastrophe as our destiny
precisely to mobilize us to work to avoid []{#part0013.xhtml#page_128}--
or at least postpone -- it. Do today's dark prophets of ecological
catastrophe not act in exactly the same way? They paint the future fixed
point of the ecological breakdown in order to mobilize us to act quickly
and decisively. The twentieth-century "determinist" Communists acted in
a similar way, although their fixed point (Communist society) was a
positive one, not a catastrophe to be avoided: Communism is necessary
but we have to fight for it continuously, we are fundamentally
responsible for it since our mistakes or opportunistic behavior may
prevent the realization of historical necessity. In some versions of
Western Marxism, the "fixed point" becomes negative, a catastrophic
telos of history to be avoided; its name is for Adorno and Horkheimer
"administered world/[verwaltete Welt]{.class_s1fv}" and for Marcuse
"one-dimensional society." The beauty of this vision is that the
negative "fixed point" is not a catastrophic turn of our societies but
something that we are sliding into if, precisely, there will be
[no]{.class_s1fv} catastrophic turn and things will just go on (more or
less) smoothly. Our destiny is the technocratic end-point towards which
history tends, the final station of the (in)famous "train of history,"
and what we should do, as Benjamin put it, is not foster historical
progress but to pull the emergency brake of the train of history. For
anti-Communists, the Communist project is, of course, a catastrophic
endpoint, and its evocation a way to mobilize people to fight against
it. They were very successful at this in the final decades of the Cold
War: the many panicked proclamations that the Cold War was over, that
Communism had already won, and this evocation of Communism as our
destiny worked perfectly, as the defeat of Communism demonstrates.
That's why, while in accord with the basic thrust of MacGowan's reading
of the relationship between Hegel and Freud, I cannot agree with his
disqualification of a key statement by Hegel as "misleading":
:::

::: class_s2m
If Hegel had access to Freud's conception of the unconscious and the
drives, he would have been able to formulate the appeal of contradiction
more straightforwardly to both himself and his readers. He wouldn't have
used the misleading terms of the good and unity to describe the
subject's actions. He wouldn't have said, near the end of the
Encyclopedic Logic, "The good, the absolute good, brings itself to
completion in the world []{#part0013.xhtml#page_129}eternally, and the
result is that it is already brought to completion in and for itself,
without needing first to wait for us." Hegel has no conceptual apparatus
to formulate how we seek out disturbances in the guise of
success.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1K3}[6](#part0014.xhtml#a1NV){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
Hegel not only knows how to "seek out disturbances in the guise of
success," the problem is that he is ambiguous in how he formulates it.
He can be read as asserting that the Absolute is playing with itself: it
creates a disturbance (alienates itself from itself, gets involved in a
struggle with itself), and enjoys playing with itself. The whole life of
the Absolute is to "seek out disturbances," and Hegel knows very well
that every success creates a new (self-)division: when the enemy is
defeated, the victor has to confront its own inconsistency ... What is
wrong in this reading is the presupposition of the same subject of the
process: the self-identical "Absolute" which plays a game with itself.
What gets lost here is the key fact that there is no self-identical
subject which plays with itself in divisions: division comes first, it
precedes what is divided, and self-identity which emerges in the course
of the process is a form of (self-)division. Without this fact, we
cannot properly understand the quoted passage from Hegel that MacGowan
dismisses as problematic. To put it in MacGowan's terms, if
reconciliation is reconciliation with contradiction, this means
precisely that, in some sense, reconciliation always-already happened --
the illusion is that reconciliation has not already happened. This is
what Hegel says in the quoted "problematic" passage, but here
interpretive problems begin. If we read this passage in a simple and
direct way, it amounts to the strongest possible assertion of the
Absolute as a self-sufficient Substance and not also a subject. In
contrast to this reading, one should insist that the "problematic"
passage is the only way to consistently formulate the idea of the
Absolute not only as substance but also as subject. The solution is not
to conceive the historical process as open, with everything depending on
us, free subjects, and every objective determination a reified
objectivization of our own creativity; it is also not a "balanced"
combination of substantial fate and the limited space of free subjective
creativity, in the sense of the famous lines from the beginning of
Marx's 18th Brumaire: "Men make their own history, but they do not make
it as they please; they []{#part0013.xhtml#page_130}do not make it under
self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already,
given and transmitted from the
past."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1SB}[7](#part0014.xhtml#a1W6){.class_s1fz} It
is not that historical necessity provided the basic frame within which
we can act freely (in the sense of Engels's notion of historical
necessity which realizes itself through a complex network of individual
contingencies). There is Fate, our future is predetermined, the Absolute
"is already brought to completion in and for itself, without needing
first to wait for us," but this very completion is our own contingent
act.
:::

::: class_s2s
In short, the paradox is that the only way to assert the possibility of
a radical change through subjective intervention is to accept
predestination and fate. Historical process is thus characterized by the
overlapping of necessity and contingency, the overlapping which was
first explicitly formulated in the Protestant idea of predestination.
It's not that a deeper necessity realizes itself through a complex set
of contingent circumstances, it's that contingent circumstances decide
the fate of necessity itself: once a thing (contingently) happens, its
occurrence retroactively becomes necessary. Our fate is not yet decided
-- not in the simple sense that we have a choice, but in a more radical
sense of choosing one's fate itself. It is also easy to see why, even if
I accept that my acts are fully predetermined, so that my free will is
an illusion, it is still rational to struggle with myself to do what I
consider to be the right thing: my acts may be totally predetermined but
I don't know in what way, so what if I am also predetermined to
passionately engage in ethical struggles with myself? This, of course,
opens up a paradoxical possibility that, perhaps, the only way to break
out of predetermined fate is to do nothing actively, to abstain from all
struggle and totally surrender to
fate.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1PD}[8](#part0014.xhtml#a1RH){.class_s1fz}

According to the standard view, the past is fixed, what happened
happened, it cannot be undone, and the future is open, it depends on
unpredictable contingencies. What we should propose here is a reversal
of this standard view: the past is open to retroactive
reinterpretations, while the future is closed since we live in a
determinist universe. This doesn't mean that we cannot change the
future; it just means that, in order to change our future we should
first (not "understand" but) change our past, reinterpret it in such a
way that opens up towards a different future from the one implied
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_131}by the predominant vision of the past. Will
there be another world war? The answer can only be a paradoxical one:
[if]{.class_s1fv} there is to be another war, it will be a necessary
one. This is how history works -- through weird reversals described by
Dupuy: "if an outstanding event takes place, a catastrophe, for example,
it could not not have taken place; nonetheless, insofar as it did not
take place, it is not inevitable. It is thus the event's actualization
-- the fact that it takes place -- which retroactively creates its
necessity."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1SR}[9](#part0014.xhtml#a1V7){.class_s1fz}
With regard to a new global war: once the conflict explodes (between US
and Iran, between China and Taiwan ...), it will appear necessary, that
is to say, we will automatically read the past that led to it as a
series of causes that necessarily caused the explosion. If it does not
happen, we will read it the way we read the Cold War today: as a series
of dangerous moments where the catastrophe was avoided because both
sides were aware of the deadly consequences of a global conflict. (So we
have today many interpreters who claim that there never was any actual
danger of a Third World War in the Cold War; that both sides were just
playing with fire.) In the time of the project, counterfactuality thus
plays a key role:
:::

::: class_s2m
The future is taken as counterfactually independent from the past
(although at the same time it depends or can depend on the past
causally); the past is taken as counterfactually depending on the future
(although it necessarily does not depend on it causally). The future is
fixed, the past is
open.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1RB}[10](#part0014.xhtml#a1JP){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
How, precisely, can the past be changed counterfactually? Here,
differentiality enters again. Recall our example from
[Ninotchka]{.class_s1fv}: we cannot change the content of a past cup of
plain coffee, but we can change its differential status from "coffee
without cream" to "coffee without milk." This mediation of every
positive existence is the stuff of "spirit," of its negativity
threatened by the prospect of Singularity. So, in the same way, with the
rise of post-humanity, does humanity become immanently a
"not-yet-Singularity"? One should be precise here: "what one anticipates
as the fixed point in the future is the future which will realize itself
if one did not anticipate it, or if one did not react to its
anticipation the way we reacted to it trying to prevent
it."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1JR}[11](#part0014.xhtml#a1PZ){.class_s1fz} The
contrast is clear here with the case of Oedipus in which the future (the
destiny foretold to Oedipus's father) realizes
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_132}itself through the very fact that it was
anticipated (told to the father) and that the father reacted to this by
way of trying to avoid it (leaving the young Oedipus in a forest,
expecting that he will die there) -- without its anticipation, fate
would not actualize itself.

To recapitulate, if, in the traditional view, the past is determined and
the future open (depending on our choice), what characterizes the future
is a disjunction: the future will be A or B, depending on our (free, not
predetermined) choice. In the "time of the project," there are no
alternative futures because the future is necessary; however, by
changing the past we can nonetheless constitute a different necessity
and thus bring about a [different]{.class_s1fv} future, the two (or
more) options are here not bifurcated but superposed, like different
states in quantum physics. This temporality thus enables us to assert
"the indeterminacy of the future in a conception of time which makes the
future a necessary
one":[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1T0}[12](#part0014.xhtml#a1KE){.class_s1fz}

::: class_s2m
Insofar as the future is not rendered present, one has to think it as
simultaneously inclusive of the catastrophic event and of its
not-taking-place -- not as disjunctive possibilities but as a
conjunction of states one or the other of which will reveal itself a

it.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1M1}[13](#part0014.xhtml#a1SS){.class_s1fz}

While, back in the years of the Cold War, the prospect of an apocalypse
was almost exclusively focused on the possibility of global nuclear war,
today there are many versions of an apocalyptic event that haunt us:
nuclear war again (such as the US versus Iran or North Korea), but also
the prospect of a global ecological catastrophe and the prospect of
humanity's passage into a post-human Singularity. (At least two other
apocalyptic events are also easily imaginable: a financial-economic
meltdown, or a digital apocalypse, i.e., the collapse of the digital
network that regulates and sustains our lives.)

According to the memoirs of Oriani-Ambrosini, Cyril Ramaphosa, in the
early 1990s the president of South Africa, drew a comparison between
boiling a frog and how the new ANC government should treat the white
minority: "In his brutal honesty, Ramaphosa told me of the ANC's 25-year
strategy to deal with the whites: it would be like boiling a frog alive,
which is done by raising the temperature
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_133}very slowly. Being cold-blooded, the frog
does not notice the slow temperature increase, but if the temperature is
raised suddenly, the frog will jump out of the water. He meant that the
black majority would pass laws transferring wealth, land, and economic
power from white to black slowly and incrementally, until the whites
lost all they had gained in South Africa, but without taking too much
from them at any given time to cause them to rebel or
fight."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1GB}[14](#part0014.xhtml#a1MN){.class_s1fz}
True or not, does this (rather unfortunate) metaphor not render
perfectly our experience of being quite literally boiled in the process
of global warming? Furthermore, there is a clear parallel in how (until
now and in the developed countries) we experience the ecological threat
and the threat of total digital control: in both cases, changes are
gradual, so that, except for brief emergencies, we are able to ignore
the effects in our daily lives ... until, all of a sudden, we will
realize that it is too late and that we have lost it
all.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1GA}[15](#part0014.xhtml#a1MP){.class_s1fz}

The "fixed point" in the future around which the time of the project
executes its circular movement (counterfactually changing the past and
thereby the causality that will -- or will not -- generate the
apocalypse) can assume different forms of (non)desirability. In the
logic of MAD and doomsday prophecies, as well as in ecological doomsday
discourse, it is a negative one (we fix on it in order to postpone/avoid
it);[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1U1}[16](#part0014.xhtml#a1SE){.class_s1fz} in
Communism it is a positive one (we evoke it to struggle for it), while
Singularity as a fixed point is open, indeterminate, divided -- it can
be positive or negative in many ways. This is why superposition of
alternate states of the necessary future is at its extreme here: the
arrival of some kind of post-humanity is generally accepted as a fact,
nobody (with the rare exception of those who plead for a Dune-like
collective decision to destroy mind-machines) perceives it as something
we should be totally opposed to. Consequently, what are superposed here
are not the two states of apocalypse arriving or not arriving, but a
multitude of versions of how the apocalypse itself will look: a
collective religious bliss, the rise of [homo deus]{.class_s1fv} (an
individual with much greater capabilities), the disappearance of human
spirituality, or ... let us reiterate our crucial question: how will the
(putative) rise of neuralink affect this paradoxical temporal structure
of the Hegelian [Aufhebung]{.class_s1fv}? Or, more precisely, how does
the rise of neuralink appear from the Hegelian standpoint? What is it,
if it is []{#part0013.xhtml#page_134}(clearly) not the
[Aufhebung]{.class_s1fv} of our humanity, its elevation to a higher
level? Furthermore, not only does neuralink not function as an
[Aufhebung]{.class_s1fv} of our humanity, as its elevation on a higher
divine-like level; its novelty resides in the fact that it eliminates
the very (symbolic) space in which [Aufhebung]{.class_s1fv} can operate
... Is, then, the Hegelian logic of contradiction still at work here,
and if yes, in what form? How does the Hegelian contradiction work?
:::

::: class_s2m
In the act of grasping the symbolic structure absolutely, as an ultimate
horizon for thought, we can illuminate the contradiction that marks the
point of the structure's internal vulnerability. This at once creates
the possibility for change and indicates that no change, no matter how
revolutionary, will ever heal the wound of the social order. A society
can move beyond a specific contradiction, but it will necessarily
encounter another one. This is not a recipe for quietism but a call to
act. The point of political contestation is to move in the direction of
an increasingly resistant contradiction, and philosophy plays a vital
role in this movement. This is Hegel's definition of progress: the
movement from more easily resolved social contradictions to more
intractable
ones.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1MR}[17](#part0014.xhtml#a1RE){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
How to reply here to the obvious reaction: why is the fact that when we
overcome one contradiction we necessarily encounter another one "not a
recipe for quietism but a call to act"? [Vulgari
eloquentia]{.class_s1fv}, if, by flushing the toilet in order to get rid
of one contradiction, you get the same shit (or, [Bulgari
eloquentia]{.class_s1fv}, you get [sŭshtoto laĭno]{.class_s1mv}) back in
an even more intractable form, why fight at all? Why not remain within
the old contradiction (say, capitalism), just trying to render it a
little bit more bearable? To put it in a slightly different way, it is
too easy to claim that reconciliation means reconciliation with
contradiction, and that all evil comes from avoiding contradictions,
i.e., to turn around the standard perspective and claim that
totalitarianism comes from trying to leave contradictions
behind.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1N8}[18](#part0014.xhtml#a1SF){.class_s1fz}
One should be more specific here: "progress" is the move from (external)
antagonism (us against the enemy) to immanent (self-)contradiction. So
it's not a Maoist celebration of eternal struggle with the enemy but an
admission of the fact that, even after you (eventually) destroy your
enemy, the new situation will []{#part0013.xhtml#page_135}continue to be
a self-contradictory one. But it is even too much to say that the denial
of self-contradiction generates the figure of the Enemy: Hitler was a
true enemy, he had to be fought and destroyed, but it would be
ridiculous to claim that the progressive forces fighting him were wrong
to externalize their inner contradiction into the external figure of an
Enemy.

This brings us to our final thesis: what eludes Singularity is another
singularity -- we might even say: singularity itself in its oppositional
determination -- namely the singularity of a pure Cartesian subject.
Nothing escapes Singularity -- nothing except this "nothing" itself, the
void of the Cartesian subject. Subject and not a human person with all
the wealth of its inner life -- we should get rid of the illusion (into
which we fall almost automatically) that, in Singularity, we will remain
basically the same humans as we are now, communicating with others,
sharing feelings, etc., just at some "higher" level. This illusion is
clearly perceptible in most of the theorists of Singularity -- Kurzweil,
for example, doesn't even notice how he automatically assumes that, even
if we are immersed in Singularity, we continue to act like "free"
responsible individuals. In short, the problem with the notion of
Singularity is not that it is too "radical" or "utopian" but that it is
not radical enough: it continues to locate the advent of Singularity in
our common universe of intersubjectivity, i.e., it ignores how the
eventual rise of Singularity will undermine the very basic
presuppositions of our intersubjective universe. If we are to take
seriously the idea that humanity is a failed passage to a higher stage,
a thwarted progress, and that what we usually perceive as the
indications of human greatness or creativity are precisely reactions to
this fundamental failure, can we then imagine a stage which would be a
humanity that somehow overcame its constitutive failure, a humanity
without sex and mortality? When the direct link of our brain with the
digital network passes a certain threshold (a quite realist prospect),
the gap that separates our self-awareness from external reality will
collapse (since our thoughts will be able to directly affect external
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_136}reality -- and vice versa -- plus will be in
direct contact with other minds). One doesn't have to follow the
conjectures of Kurzweil or the New Age fantasies like the last scene of
Kubrick's [2001]{.class_s1fv} to see that something new is effectively
emerging here. It is impossible for us to predict its exact shape, but
one thing is clear: we will no longer be singular mortal and sexed
subjects. Will we lose our singularity (and with it our subjectivity) as
well as our distance from "external" reality?
:::

::: class_s2s
This brings us back to the topic of the constitutive role of limitation
in being-human: since our -- humanity's -- "highest" achievements are
rooted in our very ultimate limitations (failure, mortality, and the
concomitant sexuality), i.e., in what we cannot but experience as the
obstacle to our "higher" spiritual existence, the idea that this
"higher" level can survive without the obstacle, without what prevents
its full actualization, is an illusion that can be accounted for in
terms of the paradox of [objet a]{.class_s1fv}, a disturbing obstacle to
perfection which engenders the very notion of perfection to which it
serves as the obstacle, so that if we abolish the obstacle, we
simultaneously lose what it is obstacle to. This paradox is operative at
multiple levels, up to the feminine beauty. A voluptuous lady from
Portugal once told me a wonderful anecdote: when her most recent lover
had first seen her fully naked, he told her that, if she lost just one
or two kilos, her body would be perfect. The truth was, of course, that
had she lost those kilos, she would probably have looked more ordinary
-- the very element that seems to disturb perfection itself creates the
illusion of the perfection it disturbs: if we take away the excessive
element, we lose the perfection itself.
:::

::: class_s2s
The crucial political example of this paradox is provided by Marx whose
fundamental mistake was to conclude, from these insights, that a new,
higher social order (Communism) is possible, an order that would not
only maintain but even raise to a higher degree and effectively fully
release the potential of the self-increasing spiral of productivity
which, in capitalism, on account of its inherent obstacle/contradiction,
is again and again thwarted by socially destructive economic crises. In
short, what Marx overlooked is that, to put it in standard Derridean
terms, this inherent obstacle/antagonism as the "condition of
impossibility" []{#part0013.xhtml#page_137}of the full deployment of the
productive forces is simultaneously its "condition of possibility": if
we abolish the obstacle, the inherent contradiction of capitalism, we do
not get the fully unleashed drive to productivity finally delivered of
its impediment, but we lose precisely this productivity that seemed to
be generated and simultaneously thwarted by capitalism -- if we take
away the obstacle, the very potential thwarted by this obstacle
dissipates. (Therein would reside a possible Lacanian critique of Marx,
focusing on the ambiguous overlapping between surplus value and surplus
enjoyment.) So the critics of Communism were in a way right when they
claimed that Marxian Communism is an impossible fantasy; what they did
not perceive is that Marxian Communism, this notion of a society of pure
unleashed productivity outside the frame of capital, was a fantasy
inherent to capitalism itself, the capitalist inherent transgression at
its purest, a strictly ideological fantasy of maintaining the thrust to
productivity generated by capitalism, while getting rid of the
"obstacles" and antagonisms that were -- as the sad experience of the
"really existing capitalism" demonstrates -- the only possible framework
of the effective material existence of a society of permanent
self-enhancing productivity.
:::

::: class_s2s
And, again, does exactly the same paradox not apply to the vision of
posthuman Singularity? The eventual rise of post-humanity will not only
compel us to grasp a new life form, it will also compel us to redefine
what constitutes humanity itself -- recall here again T.S. Eliot's
thesis that every really new work of art changes the entire past history
of art. This redefinition will concern especially the role of obstacles:
we will be compelled to accept that, in human life, finitude is
constitutive of the very transcendence which emerges against its
background.
:::

::: class_s2s
Insofar as posthumanity is, from our finite/mortal human standpoint, in
some sense the point of the Absolute towards which we strive, the
zero-point at which the gap between thinking and acting disappears, the
point at which I became [homo deus]{.class_s1fv}, we encounter here
again the paradox of our brush with the Absolute: the Absolute persists
as the virtual point of perfection in our finitude, as that X we always
fail to reach, but when we get over the limitation of our finitude we
also lose the Absolute itself. Something []{#part0013.xhtml#page_138}new
will emerge, but it will not be creative spirituality relieved of
mortality and sexuality -- in this passage to the New, we will
definitely lose both. (And sex is not just an example here: the
convoluted space of [Aufhebung]{.class_s1fv} is immanently
sexualized.)[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1TH}[19](#part0014.xhtml#a1PM){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2s
And, incidentally, the eventual withdrawal of sex that will come with
our entry into Singularity will just seal the process which already goes
on with the progressive digitalization of our lives: statistics show
that today's adolescents spend much less time with sexuality than with
surfing the web and with drugs. Even if they engage in sex, is doing it
in virtual space (with hard core pornography) not much easier and more
instantly gratifying? For this reason, the new US TV series
[Euphoria]{.class_s1fv} (described in publicity as following "a group of
high school students as they navigate drugs, sex, identity, trauma,
social media, love and friendship") is thus almost the opposite of the
portrayal of the dissolute life of today's high school population. It is
out of touch with today's young, weirdly anachronistic, more an exercise
in the middle-age nostalgia for how depraved young generations once
were.
:::

::: class_s2s
The first lesson is therefore that we should reject the celebration of
Singularity as the arrival of [homo deus]{.class_s1fv} as well as its
(almost) symmetrical opposite, the desperate claim that Singularity
amounts to the end of humanity. (A Heideggerian would for certain insist
that we are already lost: the catastrophe is not awaiting us, it has
already happened, we renounced humanity the moment we even considered
enacting Singularity -- yet another example of the temporality in which,
when something new is empirically emerging, it has already happened in
its essential dimension, at the transcendental level. This is how
Heidegger understands modern technology: the true danger does not reside
in the possibility of our nuclear etc. self-destruction, it is already
here when we relate to reality as an object of technological
exploitation.)
:::

::: class_s2s
The second lesson is that we also have to reject the premise that
underlies the opposition between the two readings of the impact of
Singularity, celebratory and catastrophic. Both readings presume that,
in Singularity, we effectively leave behind the symbolic domain of
finitude/mortality/sexuality; their difference is that, for one, the new
domain is a bliss of swimming in trans-individual awareness, and for the
other, it is, for the very same reason, a catastrophic end
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_139}of humanity. If we accept this premise, then
the only way to maintain the ethical dimension is, as we have already
seen, the Kantian one: to limit our knowledge. This is the point made
forcefully by Greenblatt (quoted earlier): the urgency of moral choice
works only if we are imperfect, if our knowledge is limited. Kant makes
it easy because In-itself is by definition inaccessible to us: there is
no choice for us here, the limitation of our knowledge is not our
choice, i.e., we are never in the position of saying: "Now I can choose
between transhuman (divine) knowledge and limited knowledge which keeps
the space open for morality!" The choice was already made by our
Creator.
:::

::: class_s2s
If, however, with the prospect of Singularity, we (humanity)
[do]{.class_s1fv} have a choice -- formally, at least, we could decide
not to develop it -- does this mean that if we choose Singularity, we
necessarily ([eo ipso]{.class_s1fv}) lose the ethical dimension: we lose
it because we get too much knowledge? One has to be more precise here:
the reason it seems that Singularity poses a threat to the ethical
dimension is not the explosive growth of our knowledge as such but, much
more, the plausibility that the immersion in Singularity will deprive us
of our status of singular individuals acting alone (in the sense of
autonomy).
:::

::: class_s2s
Let's first deal with the question of limitation: it may appear that,
when we are immersed in Singularity, we get rid of the obstacle
constituted by our mortality and finitude, and we lose the excess
generated by this obstacle. In other words, what is threatened by
Singularity is the power, the positive function, of imperfection itself,
even of straight ignorance. Hegel was fully aware of the positive
function of forgetting: for him, forgetting is not a weakness but the
expression of the Spirit's highest, "absolute," power -- the absence of
this power of forgetting (which is effectively a specific aspect of
negativity) causes a debilitating indecision, as was made clear in
Alexander Luria's classic [The Mind of a Mnemonist]{.class_s1fv}, a
short brilliant study of the case of an individual who was not able to
forget things. Although he made a living as a circus freak answering
encyclopedic questions, his subjective life was a ruin since he was not
able to make a simple decision (which involves a brutal simplification
of a complex network of pros and contras). As a result, his entire life
was organized as waiting -- waiting for some
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_140}big act or event which would happen in the
near future (but which never effectively
happened).[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1P9}[20](#part0014.xhtml#a1P3){.class_s1fz}
This notion of forgetting as not a weakness but a supreme power also
explains the passage from the absolute Idea to Nature which is precisely
the extreme point of forgetting, of self-negation.
:::

::: class_s2s
As we have already seen, when they try to describe how our life will be
in a Singularity, the partisans of Singularity as a rule show
breathtaking naivety: they describe a subject who argues and
communicates in the same way as we do, with the same worries and desires
as us, just with his powers and cognitions multiplied -- we will
basically remain the same individuals, just that we will be far stronger
and with a vastly wider scope of experiences. The question they never
raise is: but what if our inner life, inclusive of our highest spiritual
achievements, is rooted in our finite bodily existence and its
limitations, so that, with the passage into Singularity, we are deprived
of the basic features of our inner life? Konrad Lorenz made somewhere
the ambiguous remark that we ourselves (the "actually existing"
humanity) are the sought-after "missing link" between animal and man --
how are we to read it? Of course, the first association that imposes
itself here is the notion that the "actually existing" humanity still
dwells in what Marx designated as "pre-history," and that true human
history will begin with the advent of Communist society; or, in
Nietzsche's terms, that man is just a bridge, a passage between animal
and overman. (Not to mention the New Age version: we are entering a new
era in which humanity will transform itself into a Global Mind, leaving
behind petty individualism.) What Lorenz "meant" was undoubtedly
situated along these lines, although with a more humanistic twist:
humanity is still immature and barbarian, it has not yet reached full
wisdom. However, an opposite reading also imposes itself: this
intermediate status of man [is]{.class_s1fv} his greatness, since the
human being [is]{.class_s1fv} in its very essence a "passage," the
finite openness into an
abyss.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1RX}[21](#part0014.xhtml#a1GZ){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2s
The vision of a more perfect state of things which would overcome the
limitations of our present situation is thus as a rule the projection
into the future which remains grounded in our present situation -- every
image of "overman" is an illusory projection which only has sense from
within the horizon of our human finitude. This does not mean that we
cannot break out of []{#part0013.xhtml#page_141}the constraints of our
finitude; it just means that, when and if we do it (say, with our
immersion in Singularity), what we'll get will not be an actual return
to the life before the Fall, a return which would effectively undo the
entire interregnum of the Fall, but a return from the Fall in which the
trace of the Fall will persist. With Singularity, we'll get a new Fall,
a kind of Fall from the Fall: a much deeper Fall which will display the
structure of the loss of a loss. In Hegelese, what if Singularity will
work as a negation of negation: a negation which gets itself negated,
not by way of reverting to a new higher positivity but by way of
confronting us with a pure negation. We can read Hegel's "negation of
negation" qua self-relating negativity also in the sense of a position
of utter despair when the subject not only assumes a radical loss, but
is then deprived of this loss itself -- not in the sense of regaining
what was lost, but in the much more radical sense of finding itself in
the radical void after losing the very coordinates which made the loss
meaningful.

In Hitchcock's [Vertigo]{.class_s1fv}, Scottie first experiences the
loss of Madeleine, his fatal love; when he recreates Madeleine in Judy
and then discovers that the Madeleine he knew already was Judy

a fake (he knew that she was not the true Madeleine, since he recreated
a copy of Madeleine out of her), but that, because she is

Madeleine herself was already a fake -- [objet a]{.class_s1fv}

It is important to remember here that the last shot of Vertigo -- after
Judy falls from the tower, Scottie stands on the edge, looking down --
gave rise to radically opposed readings: for some interpreters, this
shot signals that Scottie survives as a totally broken man, for others,
it is a kind of happy ending (Scottie is now cured from his disease, he
can look down into the abyss) -- the ambivalence which perfectly
reproduces the ambiguity of the outcome of the Hegelian negation of
negation (utter despair or reconciliation). Scottie on the edge of the

This, then, is our hypothesis: Singularity will be such a loss of a loss
which makes the loss absolute, not a simple disappearance of
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_142}a loss, a return to new immediacy. That is
to say, what if subjectivity cannot simply be undone, but persists in
its negation in an even purer form? This is the crux of our argument for
the survival of subject in the case of its immersion in singularity: the
loss of a loss is not the restoration of the fullness prior to the loss
but the absolute loss, and the status of the subject (as opposed to
person) is that of such a loss. Let's return briefly to the topic of a
productive obstacle or limitation: in Singularity (so we are told) the
communication will be direct, without the detours which engender
supplementary spiritual wealth -- but what if, in such a situation, the
lack will return in an even stronger form, as an absolute lack, the lack
of detour itself? In other words, what if directly getting what we want
desublimates what we get and thus renders it worthless?

absolute [toská]{.class_s1fv}, the experience of the unbearable loss of
mediation/detour: we get the desired thing itself, but without the
network of mediations which makes it desirable? Such a reading points in
the direction of [toská]{.class_s1fv} as melancholy -- recall that, for
Freud, melancholy is defined by the gap between the object of our desire
and the object-cause that makes us desire it: in melancholy, we have
what we desired, but we no longer desire it. Such a structure of
melancholy clearly implies a divided subject, a subject who
(consciously) desires an object unaware of the (unconscious)
object-cause that makes him/her desire this object, so that when the
object-cause of desire fails in its function, this subject experiences
his/her situation as inconsistent, not really desiring what s/he
desires.

This brings us back to our big question: how will the fact of a wired
brain affect the dimension of what Freud called the Unconscious? The
digital big Other which registers my acts and decisions can in some
sense effectively be said to "know me better
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_143}than myself": in the example quoted by
Harari (deciding on getting
married),[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1JD}[22](#part0014.xhtml#a1RJ){.class_s1fz}
the digital Other ignores my inner feelings and intentions and can thus
identify better than myself where I really stand. Imagine a subject
submitted to commodity fetishism: just by observing and registering my
activity when I am engaged in commodity exchange, the big Other will see
that, in contrast to my professed secular rationalism, I really believe
in commodity fetishism, I act as if commodities are magical objects,
etc. With BCI, the situation is (almost) inverted: registering my inner
feelings and experience, the digital Other will identify me as a
pragmatic rationalist -- will it be able to register my unconscious
fetishism (which determines how I act)? In other words, what happens
here with the Freudo-Lacanian [divided]{.class_s1fv} subject, with a
subject split between its conscious self-experience and its unconscious
beliefs and stances? Does the whole idea of neuralink, to put it
brutally, not ignore the unconscious and reduce us to traditional
self-conscious subjectivity? Let us return to the example of my
ambiguous stance towards my father: consciously I hate him, I want to
get rid of him, but this hatred covers up my unconscious love and
attachment to him. And, as we have already seen, this other dimension is
not present ready-made in the depth of my psyche as my true realty; it
is a vague psychic thrust that insists and fully comes-to-be only in
phenomena like transference. In the case of such a divided subject, we
are not dealing here with two realities, the conscious one and the
unconscious one: the unconscious is not my deeper reality but, as Lacan
insists, a domain of the non-realized, of a purely virtual potentiality.
The unconscious hatred of my father doesn't mean that, deep in myself, I
"really hate him." It means that my public speech (of love) is disturbed
by slips of the tongue and other symptomatic acts which indicate another
dimension that resists the message of the public speech. So which stance
will be registered by the digital big Other? Again, does this not
indicate that the wired brain as the direct sharing of experiences and
conscious thoughts ignores the Unconscious?
:::

::: class_s2s
This brings us to the ambiguous status of a mask: with every additional
layer of the mediation of my communication with others, I am more and
more able to interpose between me and my partners the mask I am wearing.
Say, when I communicate with a []{#part0013.xhtml#page_144}potential
sexual partner on the web, I of course present there a constructed image
of myself which doesn't fit my reality. But this doesn't mean that I am
simply lying, masking the truth about myself. What if there are
dimensions of myself I am not ready to confront, and what if I am able
to assume them only in the guise of a fiction, telling myself "we are
just playing a game, this is not the real me"? A nice case of a "truth
which has the structure of a fiction" (as Lacan put it) is the series of
novels (or films) in which a play performed by characters (as part of
the plot) mirrors the characters' real-life amorous entanglements, like
the film about the staging of [Othello]{.class_s1fv} in which the actor
who plays Othello is effectively jealous and, when the play's final
scene is performed, he really strangles the actress who plays Desdemona
to death. Jane Austen's [Mansfield Park]{.class_s1fv} (her least popular
novel) provides an early example of this procedure. Fanny Price, a young
girl from a poor family raised at Mansfield Park by Sir Thomas, grows up
there with her four cousins, Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia, but is
treated as inferior to them; only Edmund shows her real kindness, and,
over time, a tender love grows between the two. When the children have
grown up, the stern patriarch Sir Thomas leaves for a year. During this
time, the fashionable and worldly Henry Crawford and his sister Mary
arrive in the village, and their arrival sparks a series of romantic
entanglements. The young people decide to put on a play, [Lovers'
Vows]{.class_s1fv}; Edmund and Fanny both initially oppose the plan,
believing Sir Thomas would disapprove. Edmund is eventually swayed,
reluctantly agreeing to play the part of Anhalt, the lover of the
character played by Mary Crawford, to prevent the others bringing an
outsider in to take the role. As well as giving Mary and Edmund a
vehicle to talk about love and marriage, the play provides a pretext for
Henry and Maria to flirt in public ... But let us imagine a more brutal
example: in my social reality I am a weak coward, but in my online
interactions I present myself as a cruel sadist and serial seducer. It
is not enough to say that in this way I cover up my actual weakness --
what if in my real interactions with others I suppress brutal tendencies
which come out only in the universe of digital fictions? In this case,
my screen persona is closer to the core of my being than my real-life
persona ... Will the registration of my thoughts in a wired brain be
able to distinguish between []{#part0013.xhtml#page_145}a mask which
renders my true subjective position and a mask which is effectively just
a mask concealing my true subjective stance?
:::

::: class_s2s
Therein resides the ambiguity of the (rather obvious) difference between
digital control and recording of our speech and activity, and wiring our
brain where our inner stream of consciousness itself will be shared with
others and/or a machine. It may appear that a wired brain exposes us
much more: if all our acts and sayings are registered, we can still go
on doing what we are doing and saying with fingers crossed and thus
maintain the illusion that our inner life eludes digital control.
However, if we are divided subjects (as psychoanalysis claims), i.e., if
the innermost core of our being is not accessible to the stream of our
consciousness, and if this repressed part nonetheless expresses itself
in what we do or say without willing it (slips of the tongue, etc.),
then, paradoxically, the registration of our external acts can reveal
more about the core of our being than a direct insight into our mind --
when we (think that we) wear a mask and merely play a role, there can be
more truth in the mask than in what is beneath the mask.
:::

::: class_s2s
It is crucial to bear in mind here that the gap between digital
registration and control of our activity and direct neuralink reading of
our thoughts cannot ever be abolished, the two sides cannot ever be
united in the sense of providing a complete picture of the subject under
control by way of combining external and internal data into a Whole.
External data should be interpreted with regard to what they express,
and how they express subject's inner life, but the inner life available
through neuralink should also be interpreted in view of subject's
"external" activity (did the subject really intend what he was
thinking?). It is impossible to square this circle because a third
element is missing: the virtual presence of absentials implied by both
other levels, absentials found neither in external reality nor in our
inner life of self-awareness. We are here back at the paradoxical status
of the Unconscious as the third virtual domain which is neither the
inner flow of my self-awareness (captured by neuralink), nor the reality
of my acts (captured by external digital control of my activity).

To return to [Genesis]{.class_s1fv}, the voice of Singularity is another
address by the snake; it promises the annulment of the Fall and the
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_146}achievement of immortality and superior
knowledge if we eat its fruit, i.e., if we immerse ourselves in it. As
in [Genesis]{.class_s1fv}, we should be aware that the choice is here a
forced one: we cannot but do it, no withdrawal is possible. So what will
happen? Definitely not what the proponents of Singularity expect. Like
the serpent, they are not lying, and the threat resides precisely in
their not lying. One can only say that first, there will be some kind of
catastrophe, and then, through a repetition, something new may emerge.
:::

::: class_s2s
With regard to the catastrophe, we've already mentioned the prospect of
a direct arousal of the pleasure neurons in our brain, so that we
experience a "pure" orgasm stronger than those achieved through bodily
interaction and language of seduction. But what of the opposite option:
new forms of "pure" pain and suffering? Metzinger made the same point
already apropos the "ordinary" human consciousness; "it is not at all
clear if the biological form of consciousness, as so far brought about
by evolution on our planet, is a desirable form of experience, an actual
good in
itself."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1VF}[23](#part0014.xhtml#a1PF){.class_s1fz}
This problematic feature concerns conscious pain and suffering:
evolution "has created an expanding ocean of suffering and confusion
where previously there was none. As not only the simple number of
individual conscious subjects but also the dimensionality of their
phenomenal state spaces is continuously increasing, this ocean is also
deepening."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1JV}[24](#part0014.xhtml#a1PG){.class_s1fz}
And it is reasonable to expect that new artificially generated forms of
awareness will create new "deeper" forms of suffering ... As we have
already seen, because of all these reasons, for all those who see in
neuralink a threat to our being-human, the only way out would be to opt
for the Dune solution. In Herbert's classic sci-fi novel, humanity
becomes dominated by advanced computers and collectively decides to
destroy all "thinking machines," adapting their minds to be capable of
extremely complex tasks. (This mental development is nonetheless enabled
by the use of spice mélange which improves health, extends life, enables
travel in space beyond the velocity of light, and can even bestow
limited prescience.) But, as we have already seen, it is too late for
this option -- who knows how far secret services and corporations have
already progressed in the direction of realizing different versions of
neuralink and direct control of our minds?

Here we should return to Miller's reference to Mao: yes, the obscene big
Other signals the fact that "there is a great disorder in the real" --
but, as we all know, Mao's saying goes on: "... so the situation is
excellent." So where is this other dimension absent from Miller's
reading of the capitalist real? Where is the opening ("hope") for a
radical transformation? Back to Beckett: to begin discerning this
opening, we should locate the mode of erratic-hallucinatory experience
as one of the two sides of a fractured social totality, as the
subjective aspect (selfless ego) whose objective counterpart is the
structure of global capitalism. And the same holds for Singularity: as
Miller himself indicates when he writes that "capitalism and science
combine to make nature disappear," the eventual rise of Singularity (the
ultimate "disappearance of nature" that we can imagine today) will not
be only a subjective-cosmic phenomenon, but also a phenomenon grounded
in a combination of science and capitalism -- science and the technology
which will give rise to it is not neutral but is grounded in capitalist
relations. In other words, the eventual rise of Singularity will be a
case of what we cannot but call post-human capitalism. Usually it is
posited that capitalism is (more) historical and our humanity, inclusive
of sexual difference, more basic, even ahistorical; however, what we are
witnessing today is nothing less than an essay to integrate the passage
to post-humanity into capitalism -- this is what the efforts of new
billionaire gurus like Elon Musk are about. Their prediction that
capitalism "as we know it" is coming to an end refers to "human"
capitalism, and the passage they talk about is the passage from "human"
to post-human capitalism.
:::

::: class_s2s
Singularity thus confronts us with a problem: how will the emerging
"post-human" capitalism work? And, insofar as capitalism implies
workers' exploitation, how will it continue to exploit us? In order to
unravel this problem, one has to introduce the dimension of enjoyment
into our consideration of Singularity. From the libidinal standpoint, is
Singularity not the space of an ecstatic trance of intense enjoyment, a
space in which we can fully enjoy, no longer hindered by the constraints
of our finitude? So where does libidinal exploitation enter here? To
simplify it to the utmost, it []{#part0013.xhtml#page_148}takes place
when the Other (the system that exploits us) appropriates our (its
subjects') enjoyments, when we are serving and feeding the "enjoyment of
the system (this is what exploitation ultimately stands for from the
Freudo-Lacanian
perspective)"[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1UY}[25](#part0014.xhtml#a1RN){.class_s1fz}
(247).
:::

::: class_s2s
To properly understand this claim, it is crucial to go beyond the mere
parallel between labor of enjoyment and labor of the commodity
production, between producing surplus-enjoyment and producing
surplus-value: the relationship between the two is not just that of a
formal homology, the two are moments of the same totality, which means
that their relationship is that of a mutual implication -- each is in
its way a moment of the other. So we have enjoyment of labor (enjoyment
in hard work itself which implies renunciation of enjoyment) and labor
of enjoyment (enjoyment itself is not just a passive experience, it is
the outcome of labor).
:::

::: class_s2s
The first thing to note is that economic exploitation (the production of
surplus-value) only functions if it is sustained by the enjoyment of
those exploited: "the master's discourse does not hide what it is or
what it wants. What does remain hidden is the link between exploitation
and enjoyment, the reproduction of the relations of domination by means
of the production of enjoyment"(15). In short, a master can exert his
domination only if he "bribes" the servant by way of throwing him some
crumbs of enjoyment. This enjoyment has two opposed main forms: I
directly enjoy the very subordination to the Master whom I serve. This
subordination provides a kind of security and meaning to my life; the
Master who controls me discreetly allows me to violate his prohibitions
when I am out of his view, knowing that such small transgressions will
keep me satisfied (therein resided the role of political jokes in
Communist regimes). This brings us back to Lacan's critical reading of
Hegel's dialectic of master and servant where Lacan points out that it
is the servant, not the master, who enjoys:

The work, Hegel tells us, to which the slave submits in giving up
jouissance out of fear of death, is precisely the path by which he
achieves freedom. There can be no more obvious lure than this,

Maybe, from this standpoint, we should reread the famous lines from
Hegel's [Phenomenology]{.class_s1fv} about the interrelation between
desire, [Begierde]{.class_s1fv}, enjoyment, [Genuss]{.class_s1fv}, and
labor, [Arbeit]{.class_s1fv}:
:::

::: class_s2m
Desire has reserved to itself the pure negating of the object, and, as a
result, it has reserved to itself that unmixed feeling for its own self.
However, for that reason, this satisfaction is itself only a vanishing,
for it lacks the objective aspect, or stable existence. In contrast,
work is desire held in check, it is vanishing staved off, or: work
cultivates and educates. [Die Arbeit hingegen ist gehemmte Begierde,
aufgehaltenes Verschwinden, oder sie bildet.]{.class_s1fv} The negative
relation to the object becomes the form of the object; it becomes
something that endures because it is just for the laborer himself that
the object has self-sufficiency. This negative mediating middle, this
formative doing, is at the same time singularity, or the pure being-for
itself of consciousness, which in the work external to it now enters
into the element of lasting. Thus, by those means, the working
consciousness comes to an intuition of self-sufficient being as its own
self.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1RT}[27](#part0014.xhtml#a1MM){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
We should give a Lacanian twist to the claim that "work is desire held
in check": [gehemmt]{.class_s1fv} also means "inhibited, impeded,
obstructed," and we should give to these terms all their Freudian
weight, especially with regard to the reversal of repression of desire
into desire for repression -- what if this impediment/postponement of
enjoyment generates a surplus of enjoyment on its own? Marx's "labor
theory of value" displays an unexpected homology with the key ingredient
of Freud's theory, the "labor theory of the
unconscious":[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1R1}[28](#part0014.xhtml#a1K9){.class_s1fz}
the unconscious "value" of a dream is exclusively the product of
"dream-work," not of the dream-thoughts on which dream-work exercises
its transformative activity, in the same way that the value of a
commodity is the product of the work spent on it. The paradox is here
that it is the very cyphering (obfuscation) of the dream-thought, its
translation into the dream texture, that engenders the properly
unconscious content of a dream. Freud emphasizes that the true secret of
the dream is not its content (the "dream-thoughts"), but the form
itself: the dream-work is not merely a process of masking the dream's
"true message"; the dream's true core, its unconscious wish, inscribes
itself only through this []{#part0013.xhtml#page_150}process of masking,
so that the moment we retranslate the dream-content back into the
dream-thought expressed in it, we lose the "true motive force" of the
dream -- in short, it is the process of masking itself which inscribes
into the dream its true secret. This is the core mechanism of the
"labour theory of enjoyment": surplus-enjoyment is produced by
repression itself, by encoding the dream-thought into the manifest dream
-- or, to put it more directly, renunciation of pleasure turns into
(surplus-)pleasure of renunciation. Even when we hate to indulge in
pleasures, we get caught in the trap of finding pleasure in the activity
of hating itself. Is this not the case with stern moralists whose
pleasure is palpable when they give voice to their horror at our
decadent pleasures? There are three steps in this process: first, there
is some form of direct pleasure; then, we are forced to renounce this
direct pleasure; finally, this very labor of renunciation, of
repression, generates a surplus-pleasure of its own -- the condensed
formula of this process is P-L-P, i.e., pleasure -- labor of repression
-- surplus pleasure (a formula which, of course, echoes Marx's formula
of the circulation of capital: M-C-M (money, commodity, surplus-money).
Imagine the simple example of compulsive rituals: a compulsive
(obsessional) neurotic finds some of his desires intolerable, he fights
them, so he establishes rituals of self-punishment by means of which he
tries to keep his intolerable desires at bay, but then he starts to
enjoy these rituals themselves ... I fight my sinful sexual desires by
painfully whipping myself, but then I start to enjoy self-flagellation
itself because, in a negative form, it reminds me that the prohibited
desires are still active in me.
:::

::: class_s2s
So, again, how does exploitation enter here? In terms of libidinal
economy, the way to do it is to mobilize the distinction between drive
and desire. The desire (or, rather, drive) of capitalism itself is not
the capitalist's desire -- the latter can vary in all its pathological
declinations, it can be the desire to take revenge, to amass wealth, to
expand construction and produce more, or whatsoever, while the desire of
capitalism itself is a monotonous drive towards expanded reproduction.
(And why should we not also add Communism, i.e., the distinction between
the desire of a Communist and the desire of Communism itself?) In order
to avoid a new kind of animism (of desires inhabiting objective social
processes), one []{#part0013.xhtml#page_151}should nonetheless inquire
into the more precise status of this non-subjectivized desire: although
non-subjective, it still functions as something that presupposes
subjectivity (since it only functions as presupposed by it). This is why
it is not enough to focus on the private vices of individual
capitalists: the best servants of capital may well be those who ignore
their private vices and are totally dedicated to the "higher loyalty" of
the smooth circulation of capital. Homologous to this distinction is
that between the private desires of individual state functionaries and
the "desire" embodied in the functioning of state apparatuses. The
campaign against Trump and for his impeachment tells a lot about our
politico-ideological predicament. Trump is portrayed as an individual
pursuing his own private interests, not as the representative of a state
and its apparatuses. Edward Snowden immediately got this point,
commenting that
:::

::: class_s2m
a whistleblower's complaint, which triggered US President Donald Trump's
impeachment inquiry, is strategically "quite wise" in its focus on the
president versus an institution ... Congress could be more than happy to
throw an individual abusing their office under the bus, in a way that
they are not willing to do when they themselves are implicated by the
same allegations.... This whistleblower is doing something \[that's\] a
little bit unusual. They're alleging that an individual is breaking the
law who, of course, is the president, \[who\] is historically unpopular
at this
moment.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1R2}[29](#part0014.xhtml#a1UW){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
It is thus acceptable to criticize an individual who breaks the law
while he pursues his interests or private pathological inclinations
(revenge, lust for power and glory ...), but it is much more difficult
to discern a crime in the activity of a state institution, a criminal
activity which is performed by personally honest individuals dedicated
to their job -- evil and crime are here not individualized, but
inscribed into the very functioning of the institution.
:::

::: class_s2s
Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's much celebrated [Lives of
Others]{.class_s1fv} (2006) falls into the same trap: as is the case
with many depictions of the harshness of Communist regimes, the film
misses the true horror of the situation in its very attempt to portray
it. How? What sets in motion the film's plot is the corrupt minister of
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_152}culture who wants to get rid of the top GDR
playwright, Georg Dreyman, so that he will be able to pursue unimpeded
his affair with Dreyman's partner, the actress Christa-Maria. In this
way, the horror inscribed into the very formal structure of the system
is relegated to an effect of a personal whim -- the point lost is that
without the minister's personal corruption, with only dedicated and
devoted bureaucrats, the system would be no less terrifying. In the real
German Democratic Republic, a writer like Dreyman, famous and published
also in the West, would have been under constant surveillance (as was
the case with all famous GDR authors from Bertolt Brecht to Heiner
Muller), even if no high apparatchik were to desire his wife.
:::

::: class_s2s
And exactly the same holds for the impeachment of Trump. It can be
argued that Trump is a repellant person lacking a basic moral compass;
however, what about the systematic violations of human rights in the
continuous activities of the US intelligence agencies? The true enemies
are not idiosyncratic figures who act as a disturbance to the
establishment itself; the true enemies are honest patriotic bureaucrats
ruthlessly pursuing US goals. To name names, the model of such a
patriotic bureaucrat is James Comey, the FBI director deposed by Trump.
Although, at the level of facts, Comey was probably mostly truthful in
his critique of Trump (see his memoir [A Higher Loyalty]{.class_s1fv}),
one should nonetheless admit that his "higher loyalty" to the principles
and values of the US leaves untouched what one cannot but call the
criminal tendencies inscribed into US state institutions, i.e., all that
was revealed by Assange, Snowden and Manning.
:::

::: class_s2s
One should also not forget that the movement to impeach Trump is mostly
motivated by the desire to prove that Russia influenced the last
presidential elections, enabling Trump to win. While there probably was
Russian meddling (in the same way that the US tries to influence
elections all around the world, with the difference being that they call
their interventions "a defence of democracy"), the focus on this aspect
obfuscates the true reason for Clinton's defeat, her ruthless struggle
against Bernie Sanders and the leftist wing of the Democratic Party.
Sanders was right to warn that "if for the next year, year-and-a-half,
going right into the heart of the election, all that the Congress is
talking about []{#part0013.xhtml#page_153}is impeaching Trump and Trump,
Trump, Trump, and Mueller, Mueller, Mueller, and we're not talking about
health care, we're not talking about raising the minimum wage to a
living wage, we're not talking about combating climate change, we're not
talking about sexism and racism and homophobia, and all of the issues
that concern ordinary Americans, what I worry about is that works to
Trump's
advantage."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1MW}[30](#part0014.xhtml#a1PJ){.class_s1fz}
Impeaching Trump is not a leftist project, it is a centrist-liberal
project whose secret aim is also to weaken the leftist turn of the
Democratic Party.

This brings as back to Marx: some of the best recent readings of Marx's
[Capital]{.class_s1fv} shift the focus from the first to the second
volume which deals with the circulation of capital, i.e., the cycle of
its expanded self-reproduction; plus, in order to clarify this circular
structure, they refer to the category of life as it is deployed in the
second part of Hegel's subjective logic (not life from his philosophy of
nature, but life in its purely logical structure, life as "second
nature," as the objective self-reproductive movement of the notion that
follows the subjective triad of notion-judgment-syllogism. The thesis
that underlies this reading is that the self-movement of capital, its
"life," is the actual base of Hegel's notion of the Absolute, of the
absolute Idea: capital in its self-movement is the actuality of the
Hegelian absolute subject. I find this reading, perspicuous as it is,
problematic insofar as it has to conceive of the proletarian revolution,
the breaking out of the capitalist system, as a move outside dialectics,
into some non-mediated radical Otherness. Furthermore, to put it
somewhat in simplified Lacanian terms, the problematic premise of this
reading is that capital is a big Other which exists, not an Other which
only persists as a virtual point of reference of subjects who act as if
it exists.
:::

::: class_s2s
In the functioning of pre-digital capitalism as described by Marx, the
tension between drive and desire remains fully operative: capital's
drive is not the same as the desire of an individual capitalist who
serves capital's self-reproduction. At this libidinal level,
exploitation equals serving the enjoyment of the Other -- the subject's
desire is subordinated to the Other's drive, so that even if I suffer
pain, I accept it if this pain serves the Other's enjoyment, i.e.,
capital's infinite drive for expanded self-reproduction -- the infinite
self-circulation of capital (as the "automatic subject")
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_154}parasitizes my finite desire. This enjoyment
is, of course, not psychological, it is impersonal, a moment of the
objective social structure of capital, but still not simply objective:
it is presupposed by individual subjects as a virtual point of reference
(in the same sense as the symbolic big Other is virtual: a
non-psychological entity that only exists as the virtual point of
reference of subjects and their activity). But what happens with
Singularity, with my direct immersion in the collective space of the
Other, is that the gap that separates subject's desire from the Other's
drive collapses: when I am in a Singularity, my thoughts are no longer
mine, they are directly the thoughts of Singularity thinking itself, I
directly participate in the Other's drive.
:::

::: class_s2s
This is why the prospect of Singularity opens up a way to step outside
capitalism. Why does capitalism exert such ideological fascination? Why
does it appear to many people as the social order that best fits human
nature? Even many leftists privately admit that capitalism is the only
thing that really works, and resign themselves to a more
welfare-and-human-rights oriented capitalism, abandoning "full"
socialism as an unworkable utopia ... Todd
MacGowan[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1VM}[31](#part0014.xhtml#a1ND){.class_s1fz}
provided a Lacanian explanation of the resiliency of capitalism, boldly
admitting that, in some (very qualified) sense capitalism effectively
does fit "human nature." In contrast to premodern social orders which
obfuscate the paradox of human desire and presume that desire is
structured in a straightforward teleological way (we humans strive
towards some ultimate goal, be it happiness or another kind of material
or spiritual fulfilment, and aim at finding peace and satisfaction in
its achievement), capitalism is the first and only social order that
incorporates into its functioning the basic paradox of human desire.
This paradox concerns the functioning of surplus in our libidinal
economy: whatever we achieve is never "that," we always want something
else and more, and the ultimate aim of our desire is not to achieve some
ultimate goal but to reproduce its own endless self-reproduction in an
ever expanded form. This is why the imbalance of the system defines
capitalism: capitalism can only thrive through its own constant
self-undermining and revolutionizing. The paradox is that, because we
desire the surplus that eludes every object, our very orientation
towards pleasure []{#part0013.xhtml#page_155}and satisfaction compels us
to permanently sacrifice available satisfactions on behalf of
satisfactions to come -- in capitalism, hedonism and asceticism coincide
-- or, to quote the concise recapitulation from the cover of MacGowan's
book:
:::

::: class_s2m
Capitalism hides sacrifice and thus enables us to find our satisfaction
in it without ever avowing the link between sacrifice and satisfaction.
All satisfaction depends on some form of sacrifice -- of time, of
resources, of utility, and so on -- but capitalism disguises sacrifice
as self-interest, which enables capitalist subjects to engage in
satisfying sacrifices while believing that they are just pursuing their
self-interest.
:::

::: class_s2p
What capitalism mobilizes and simultaneously obfuscates is that the
ultimate source of pleasure is sacrifice itself: capitalism obfuscates
this paradox by permanently dangling before our (producer's and
consumer's) eyes the deceitful promise of future satisfaction. In short,
instead of admitting that the promise of future satisfaction is just an
illusory ploy to justify the present sacrifice and renunciations,
capitalism turns things around and presents sacrifices and renunciations
as means to achieve future satisfaction. Once this devilish logic of
surplus is directly mobilized, there is no return to pre-capitalist
balance -- as Marx already saw clearly, liberation is possible only
through capitalism. But what kind of liberation? One has to reject the
dream of a different new libidinal economy outside the paradoxes of
sacrifice and surplus, this secret dream of most socialist and other
radical utopias. The paradoxical structure of human desire is a kind of
a priori: we cannot step out of it and (re)establish some new balanced
universe in which we will not be fixated on a surplus, but just work for
our satisfactions.
:::

::: class_s2s
So how are we to step out of capitalism without falling into the
premodern vision of a balanced universe? How to admit the basic
structure of human desire without concluding that, since capitalism
mobilizes this structure, it is in some sense unsurpassable, "eternal"
and natural? As we have just seen, capitalism mobilizes this structure
and simultaneously obfuscates its paradox. Consequently, the only
solution is (not to say no to sacrifice and renunciation but) to openly
admit and assume sacrifice and renunciation as such,
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_156}with no teleological justification in future
satisfactions. This is a difficult move since it involves admitting a
very traumatic fact -- recall the Stalinist purges in which millions
were sacrificed on behalf of a future happy society, covering up the
fact that the vision of future happiness served as a mask obfuscating
the obscene pleasure of sacrifice as such. This is what, in the very
last pages of his [Seminar XI]{.class_s1fv}, Lacan alludes to when he
says that
:::

::: class_s2m
the offering to obscure gods of an object of sacrifice is something to
which few subjects can resist succumbing, as if under some monstrous
spell. Ignorance, indifference, an averting of the eyes may explain
beneath what veil this mystery still remains hidden. But for whoever is
capable of turning a courageous gaze towards this phenomenon -- and,
once again, there are certainly few who do not succumb to the
fascination of the sacrifice in itself -- the sacrifice signifies that,
in the object of our desires, we try to find evidence for the presence
of the desire of this Other that I call here the dark
God.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1NU}[32](#part0014.xhtml#a1NF){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
The alternative to this "monstrous spell" is not a happy life without
sacrifices, but a "sacrifice" (expenditure) which is not an "offering to
dark Gods," i.e., which does not aim to do what it does for the
enjoyment of the divine Other. Can we do it? Perhaps, the prospect of
Singularity opens here a new prospect. When we are immersed in
Singularity, the standard capitalist game of working for the enjoyment
of the Other (Capital) while under the spell of pursuing one's
self-interest can no longer work. This game can only function insofar as
the distance between (infinite Capital's) drive and (finite subject's)
desire is maintained, but in Singularity, this distance gets blurred:
desire gets drowned in drive, alienation is full and directly palpable,
giving us a chance to get rid of it.
:::

::: class_s2s
Let us return from this point back to [The Matrix]{.class_s1fv} which
stages precisely such a full alienation. The premise of [The
Matrix]{.class_s1fv}[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1PC}[33](#part0014.xhtml#a1MK){.class_s1fz}
is that the very reality we live in, the fake reality staged by the
Matrix, is in place so that we can effectively be reduced to a passive
state of living batteries providing the Matrix with energy. The unique
impact of the film thus resides not so much in its central thesis (that
what we experience as reality is an artificial virtual reality generated
by the "Matrix," the mega-computer directly attached to
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_157}all our minds), but in its central image of
millions of human beings leading a claustrophobic life in a water-filled
cradle, kept alive in order to generate the energy (electricity) for the
Matrix. So when (some of the) people "awaken" from their immersion in
the Matrix-controlled virtual reality, this awakening is not the opening
into the wide space of the external reality, but first the horrible
realization of this enclosure, where each of us is effectively just a
fetus-like organism, immersed in the pre-natal fluid ... This utter
passivity is the ultimate [perverse]{.class_s1fv} fantasy, the notion
that we are ultimately [instruments]{.class_s1fv} of the Other's (the
Matrix's) [jouissance]{.class_s1fv}, sucked out of our life-substance
like batteries. Therein resides the true libidinal enigma of this
[dispositif]{.class_s1fv}: WHY does the Matrix [need]{.class_s1fv} human
energy? The purely energetic solution is, of course, meaningless: the
Matrix could have easily found another, more reliable, source of energy
which would have not demanded the extremely complex arrangement of the
virtual reality coordinated for millions of human units. The only
consistent answer is: the Matrix feeds on the human's [jouissance
--]{.class_s1fv} so we are here back at the fundamental Lacanian thesis
that the big Other itself, far from being an anonymous machine, needs
the constant influx of [jouissance]{.class_s1fv}. This is how we should
turn around the state of things presented by the film: what the film
renders as the scene of our awakening into our true situation, is
effectively its exact opposition, the very fundamental fantasy that
sustains our being. So it is not that we (the exploited) do not enjoy
but just work for the enjoyment of the Other -- we do enjoy, even
emphatically (as it is clearly rendered by the central image of the
film, humans in a fetus-like passive position silently enjoying), and it
is this very enjoyment that is appropriated by the Other -- this Other
which can be the Capital in consumerist exploitation, the bureaucracy in
state exploiting its subjects ... and, in a homologous way, the
Singularity exploiting us when we enjoy our immersion in it.
:::

::: class_s2s
And this brings us to the paradox of exploitation at work in the Matrix:
the enjoyment the Matrix sucks from individuals does not set the
individuals free, what they get from the Matrix for continuously
providing with enjoyment is a growing state of indebtedness: the more
enjoyment is sucked out of individuals by the Matrix, the more debt
these individuals occur. For this reason,
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_158}the subject's alienation can also be
formulated in terms of infinite debt: in alienation, indebted, haunted
by a debt it can never repay, whose repayment is an infinite task. And
it is homologous with states themselves: from the rise of capitalism,
states have reproduced themselves by becoming indebted. Here we have a
nice example of the properly historical dialectics in which something
that emerges as such only today (universal indebtedness) is seen as
operative from the very beginning of capitalism. Marx wrote that "with
the emergence of state indebting, lack of faith in the national debt
takes the place of the sin against the Holy Ghost, for which there is no
forgiveness."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1NP}[34](#part0014.xhtml#a1N6){.class_s1fz}
Are these lines today not more actual than ever -- recall the Greek
crisis which was all about debt and was "solved" with [more
debt]{.class_s1fv}, of course? This shift from exploited worker to
indebted individual has radical political consequences: it makes the
rise of class consciousness, i.e., transformation of the exploited
workers into proletarians aware of their revolutionary historical role,
almost impossible since their indebtedness individualizes them:
"Neoliberal capitalism has established an asymmetric class struggle that
it governs. There is only one class gathered around finance, the power
of credit and money as capital. The working class is no longer a class.
The number of workers has considerably increased since the 1970s all
around the world, but they no longer constitute a political class and
will never again constitute one. The workers do have a sociological and
economic
existence"[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1JT}[35](#part0014.xhtml#a1N7){.class_s1fz}
-- no longer as a proletarian class but as indebted individual
responsible for their fate. Althusser's formula of ideology as
interpellation of individuals into subjects is here turned around:
ideology interpellates subjects into (indebted) individuals.
:::

::: class_s2s
Will then Singularity also work like the Matrix, as the Substance that
will feed on our enjoyment? There are good arguments for this. All
descriptions of Singularity [de facto]{.class_s1fv} point towards a
structure of radical alienation, to the rise of a new form of the divine
big Other into which the subject is fully immersed so that the subject's
activity coincides with the activity of Singularity itself (recall
Lacan's definition of male mysticism as a perverse structure in which my
view of god coincides with god's view of himself). Marx wrote that with
large factory machine industry, the form of production
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_159}process in its material reality fits
capitalist structure: the worker is no longer an artisan who
individually uses his tools to work on some matter but an appendix to a
machine taking care of its smooth functioning. In the same way the
worker is an appendix to capital. Is, in a homologous way, the very form
of Singularity not a structure of radical alienation in which the
subject is thoroughly deprived of all content, inclusive of its inner
life? We should pursue this parallel between Singularity and capital
further. Gerard Lebrun mentions the "fascinating image" of the Capital
presented by Marx (especially in his [Grundrisse]{.class_s1fv}): "a
monstrous mixture of the good infinity and the bad infinity, the good
infinity which creates its presuppositions and the conditions of its
growth, the bad infinity which never ceases to surmount its crises, and
which finds its limit in its own
nature."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1NR}[36](#part0014.xhtml#a1TR){.class_s1fz}
Actually, it is in [Capital]{.class_s1fv} itself that we find this
Hegelian description of the circulation of capital:
:::

::: class_s2m
in the circulation M-C-M, both the money and the commodity represent
only different modes of existence of value itself, the money its general
mode, and the commodity its particular, or, so to say, disguised mode.
It is constantly changing from one form to the other without thereby
becoming lost, and thus assumes an automatically active character ...
Value, therefore, being the active factor in such a process, and
assuming at one time the form of money, at another that of commodities,
but through all these changes preserving itself and expanding, it
requires some independent form, by means of which its identity may at
any time be established. And this form it possesses only in the shape of
money. It is under the form of money that value begins and ends, and
begins again, every act of its own spontaneous
generation.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1V8}[37](#part0014.xhtml#a1NZ){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
Note how Hegelian references abound here: with capitalism, value is not
a mere abstract "mute" universality, a substantial link between the
multiplicity of commodities; from the passive medium of exchange, it
turns into the "active factor" of the entire process. Instead of only
passively assuming the two different forms of its actual existence
(money -- commodity), it appears as the subject "endowed with a motion
of its own, passing through a life-process of its own": it
differentiates itself from itself, positing its otherness,
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_160}and then again overcomes this difference --
the entire movement is [its own]{.class_s1fv} movement. In this precise
sense, "instead of simply representing the relations of commodities, it
enters ... into private relations with itself": the "truth" of its
relating to its otherness is its self-relating, i.e., in its
self-movement, the capital retroactively "sublates" its own material
conditions, changing them into subordinate moments of its own
"spontaneous expansion" -- in pure Hegelese, it posits its own
presuppositions. Crucial in the quoted passage is the expression "an
automatically active character," an inadequate translation of the German
words used by Marx to characterize capital as "[automatischem
Subjekt]{.class_s1fv}," an "automatic subject," the oxymoron uniting
living subjectivity and dead automatism. This is what capital is: a
subject, but an automatic one, not a living one -- and, again, can Hegel
think this "monstrous mixture," a process of subjective self-mediation
and retroactive positing of presuppositions which as it were gets caught
in a substantial "spurious infinity," a subject which itself becomes an
alienated substance?
:::

::: class_s2s
And, afresh, does exactly the same not also hold for Singularity into
which we will eventually be immersed? Will Singularity not be a new
version of such an "automatic subject"? We should bring this parallel to
its conclusion: in the same way as the figure of capital as an automatic
subject is an ideological fantasy (although a fantasy with real social
effects, immanent to the movement of the capital), the figure of
Singularity as a divine mega-Subject in whose activity we participate is
also another ideological fantasy. Singularity does not imply our
alienation in the (symbolic/virtual) big Other: Singularity will take
place in the Real. However, insofar as subject will be not just immersed
in Singularity but also radically alienated in Singularity (since, as we
have speculated, the subject will survive in it as the evanescent point
of pure void), is then "separation" here not the Unconscious itself as
correlative to the pure subject (\$)? In short, does the virtual big
Other itself not enable us to acquire a minimum of separation from the
digital big Other? Is the Symbolic as such not a minimal form of
separation?
:::

::: class_s2s
The problem is, of course, that in our dealing with the digital network,
these two dimensions (the virtual/symbolic big Other and the actual
digital big Other) tend to get confused, so that we
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_161}tend to project onto the digital machine
which is part of material reality the dimension of the symbolic big
Other, to treat it as a "subject supposed to know" (or not to know,
i.e., the entity from which we succeed in hiding our intimate secrets).
One can argue that this confusion is what defines the notion of
Singularity: a materially existing big Other which is simultaneously a
divine Other. This confusion brings us close to paranoia: in paranoia,
the virtual Other -- which, as Lacan put it, doesn't exist -- is
perceived as existing in reality (in the guise of our persecutor). In
order to fight this confusion, the two dimensions have to be kept apart,
which means that the digital Other (the digital network) has to be
treated as what it is, as a vast stupid machine which operates blindly.
:::

::: class_s2s
To resume, human participants who inhabit Singularity automatically (in
an effect of spontaneous ideology) conflate the real digital Other (the
digital machine that sustains the contact between wired brains and
thereby our immersion in Singularity) with the symbolic "big Other" --
the two surreptitiously coincide, the real Other (the digital machine
that sustains our immersion in Singularity) is elevated into the
symbolic big Other, it is perceived as a figure of symbolic authority,
as a divine partner or space in which I dwell. The first task of the
critique of ideology is therefore here to desublimate Singularity, to
reintroduce the distance between the two dimensions, to reduce the
digital Other to the stupidity of a blind machine, to deprive it of the
aura of a secret
Master.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1GP}[38](#part0014.xhtml#a1KP){.class_s1fz}
In short, the figure of Singularity should be desublimated, deprived of
the dignity of a Thing.
:::

::: class_s2s
However, how are we to combine this urgent need to desublimate
Singularity, to deprive it of its quasi-divine status, with the proposal
to determine the shift from repression (which sustains exploitation) to
a new libidinal economy without repressive exploitation as a move from
repression to sublimation? "In the regime of repression the only change
possible is the change of objects, but not 'the change of object in
itself.'" One should give to these lines their full Hegelian dignity,
recalling Hegel's claim that in experience [Erfahrung]{.class_s1fv} it
is not only our perception of the object that changes but the object
itself. So how does this change work? What does the subject do with the
object? Instead of repression, i.e., repressive displacement of our
libidinal investment from one []{#part0013.xhtml#page_162}object to
another (as in our example of compulsive behavior where our libidinal
investment is displaced from the illicit activity to the ritual of
punishment for this activity), the subject enacts sublimation -- the
same object (in this case the illicit sexual activity) is "elevated to
the dignity of the Thing," the impossible-real object of desire.
:::

::: class_s2s
In order to grasp how exploitation is overcome by sublimation, it is not
enough to stay with this standard definition of sublimation as the
elevation of an ordinary object to the dignity of a Thing. As Lacan
aptly demonstrated apropos courtly love, an ordinary object (woman) is
there elevated to the dignity of the Thing, she becomes an "inhuman
partner," dangerous to get too close to, always out of reach, mixing
horror and respect. The paradox of desire is here brought to an extreme,
turning the experience of love into an endlessly postponed tragedy. In
true love, however, comedy enters: while the beloved remains a Thing, it
is simultaneously "desublimated," accepted in all her ridiculous bodily
imperfections. A true miracle is thus achieved: I can hold the
Thing-[jouissance]{.class_s1fv} in my hands, making fun of it and
playing games with it, enjoying it without restraint -- true love
doesn't idealize -- or, as Lacan put it in his seminar on anxiety: "Only
love-sublimation makes it possible for [jouissance]{.class_s1fv} to
condescend to
desire."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1PN}[39](#part0014.xhtml#a1JS){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2s
This enigmatic proposition was perspicuously interpreted by Alenka
[Zupančič]{.class_s1hr} who demonstrated how, in the comedy of love,
sublimation paradoxically comprises its opposite, desublimation -- you
remain the Thing, but simultaneously I can use you for my enjoyment: "to
love the other and to desire my own [jouissance]{.class_s1fv}. To
'desire one's own [jouissance']{.class_s1fv} is probably what is the
hardest to obtain and to make work, since the enjoyment has trouble
appearing as an
object."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1GX}[40](#part0014.xhtml#a1M0){.class_s1fz}
One should not shirk from a quite concrete and graphic description of
what this amounts to: I love you, and I show this by fucking you just
for pleasure, mercilessly objectivizing you -- this is how I am no
longer exploited by serving the Other's enjoyment. When I worry all the
time whether you also enjoy it, it is not love -- "I love you" means: I
want to be used as an object for your enjoyment. One should reject here
all the Catholic nonsense of preferring the missionary position in sex
because lovers can whisper tender words and communicate spiritually, and
even Kant was too short here when he reduced the sexual act to reducing
my []{#part0013.xhtml#page_163}partner to an instrument of my pleasure:
self-objectivization [is]{.class_s1fv} the proof of love, you find being
used degrading only if there is no love. This enjoyment of mine should
not be constrained even by the tendency to enable my partner to reach
orgasm simultaneously with me -- Brecht was right when, in his poem
"Orges Wunschliste," he includes in the wish-list of his preferences
non-simultaneous orgasms: ["Von den Mädchen, die neuen. / Von den
Weibern, die ungetreuen. / Von den Orgasmen, die ungleichzeitigen. / Von
den Feindschaften, die beiderseitigen."]{.class_s1fv} "Of the girls, the
new. / Of the women, the unfaithful. / Of orgasms, the non-simultaneous.
/ Of the animosities, the mutual."
:::

::: class_s2s
But there seem to be two sublimations in another sense: the "good" one
(sublimating the object instead of submitting it to the labor of
repression), and the "bad" one of sublimating (elevating to the dignity
of a Thing) capital (or Singularity) into a divine Thing, a trans-human
monster that automatically reproduces itself through us, through our
activity. There is a subtle difference between the two: what is
sublimated in the "bad" sublimation is not a concrete libidinal object
or practice but the very global space of the alienated force that
controls our lives and exploits us, libidinally and/or economically. To
clarify this distinction between the two modes of sublimation, we have
to further specify the shift from repression to sublimation
characterized by [Tomšič]{.class_s1hr} as the shift from the infinite
(substance) parasitizing on finite (individuals/subjects) to infinite as
the inflection of the finite (subject): "if repression stands for a
parasitism of infinite on the finite and the exploitation of the
subject's alienation, then sublimation is grounded on an inverse
parasitism, that of the finite on the infinite" -- this parasitism means
that a finite ordinary object parasitizes on the infinite Thing. So,
again, in the "bad" sublimation, singular objects are not elevated to
the dignity of a Thing, they are merely reduced to a vanishing moment in
the eternal circular movement of the Thing which passes from one to
another form of appearance, while, in the "good" sublimation, a singular
object, in its very finitude, stands for the Thing, i.e., parasitizes on
the infinite. It's like in love where a singular ordinary person, with
all of her or his faults, turns into the unshakable fixed point of my
libidinal investment. These two forms of sublimation are well-known from
tradition: the "bad" one is that []{#part0013.xhtml#page_164}of
traditional wisdom -- all phenomena are passing, the only Real Thing is
the Abyss into which all that is disappears -- while the true one is
best encapsulated by the Christian notion of love violently privileging
a singular subject, a love that is exclusive, introducing extreme
imbalance into the universe.
:::

::: class_s2s
However, the formula of inverted parasitism is in itself insufficient.
Capitalist production for the sake of production only works if it is
experienced by the workers as production to satisfy their needs,
externally teleological. It is thus the very capitalist parasitizing of
the infinite (capital) on the finite (worker) which "finitizes" the
worker. In Communism, it will not be simply the finite which parasitizes
on the infinite, but a different infinite -- infinite is subject itself,
the loop of its self-enhancing productivity, and let's not forget that
subject is in its very notion a singular entity, a One that excludes the
multiplicity of reality. This is why "production for the sake of
production," and not to satisfy the worker's needs, is not just a form
of capitalist alienation: it also defines Communism in which production
is for its own sake, to fulfill our creative potentials. In other words,
the problem with the "bad" sublimation is that the Infinite which
parasitizes on transient finites is a case of what Hegel called "bad
(spurious) infinity."
:::

::: class_s2s
When we move beyond alienation, subjectivity (its singular force of
negativity) is, of course, fully asserted, but not in the usual
"Hegelian" sense that served as a model for Marx (a subject
re-appropriates alienated substance, recognizes it as its own work);
what happens in dis-alienation is just the redoubling of alienation,
which Lacan called separation. What gets separated from what here if
alienation already stands for the separation of the Other from the
subject (who is also in this way decentered, separated from itself, with
its center of gravity outside itself)? The big Other gets separated from
itself, it gets de-substantialized, inconsistent, lacking a foundation,
moving in a circle, cut through with antagonisms. We encounter here
again the Hegelian topic of disparity: redoubling alienation means that
the subject's disparity with substance is reflected back into Substance
itself, as its disparity with itself.
:::

::: class_s2s
This distinction between alienation and separation also compels us to
approach in a new way our engagement against the threat of
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_165}an ecological catastrophe. One often hears
that, in order to confront appropriately the threat of an ecological
catastrophe, we have to renounce "anthropocentrism" and to conceive of
ourselves (humanity) as a subordinated element in the great chain of
Being: we are just one species on our planet, but through our ruthless
exploitation of its resources, we (humanity) are posing a threat to our
mother Earth, and that Earth is punishing us through global warming and
other ecological threats ... One cannot but laugh at this vision: not
Earth, but [we]{.class_s1fv} are in trouble, Earth is indifferent, it
has survived much worse disasters than the possible self-destruction of
one of its species. What is under threat is [our]{.class_s1fv}
environment, [our]{.class_s1fv} habitat, the only one in which we can
live. From the imagined standpoint of Earth it would be much better for
its global ecosystem if we (humanity) disappeared, so what is under
threat in "ecological crisis" is [our]{.class_s1fv} survival, the
survival of our society. And therein resides the hidden anthropocentrism
of such anti-anthropocentric visions: in spite of all the babble about
privileging Earth over our interests, what we are after is (an
environment that would befit) our survival and well-being. This is also
why the true stakes of ecology are socio-political: ecology is not about
caring for Nature, it is about a social reorganization to maximize the
conditions of our well-being. Greta Thunberg is fully aware of this:
when she refers to science (admonishing politicians to listen to
science), she addresses politicians, not scientists: her aim is not to
leave politics behind, it is not depoliticization, but to contribute to
the rise of a new politics, a politics that would be effectively
universal, addressing us all while (as befits all politics) still
dividing us (i.e., fighting against those who deny the threat of an
ecological catastrophe). Ecological struggle is politics at its most
radical.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1K8}[41](#part0014.xhtml#a1G8){.class_s1fz}
Another version of universal politics is the one associated with the
names Assange-Snowden-Manning, that of "spying for the people,"
disclosing to the public problematic state secrets. With regard to one's
own sovereign state, such an activity is "treasonous," which is why it
is by definition universal, i.e., "betraying" one's fidelity to one's
own state.
:::

::: class_s2s
Greta did change in the last months: she changed from the naïve and
innocent girl saying that the emperor is naked to a smiling-aggressive
sharp-tongued demon; but her message remains the
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_166}same, simple and repeated. One should recall
here Kierkegaard's wonderful short text "On the Difference between
Genius and Apostle," where he defines genius as the individual who is
able to express/articulate "that which is in him more than himself," his
spiritual substance, in contrast to the apostle who "in himself" does
not matter at all: the apostle is a purely formal function of the one
who dedicated his life to bearing witness to an impersonal Truth that
transcends him. He is a messenger who was chosen (by grace): he
possesses no inner features that would qualify him for this role. Lacan
mentions here a diplomat who serves as a representative of his country:
his idiosyncrasies are irrelevant, whatever he does is read as a message
from his country to the country in which he is posted -- if, at a big
diplomatic conference, he coughs, this is interpreted as softly
signaling his state's doubt about the measures debated at the
conference, etc. And Lacan's paradoxical conclusion is that the Freudian
"subject of the unconscious" (or what Lacan calls "subject of the
signifier") has the structure of the Kierkegaardian apostle: he is the
witness of an "impersonal" Truth. Is what we encounter in hysteria not
precisely a "body of truth": in the bodily symptoms that result from the
hysterical "conversion," the immediate organic body is invaded,
kidnapped, by a Truth, transformed into a bearer of truth, into a
space/surface onto which the Truths (of the unconscious) are inscribed
-- hysteria is the ultimate case of Lacan's [c'est moi, la verite, qui
parle]{.class_s1fv}. In short, the structure is here that of a
Kierkegaardian apostle: the body is cancelled/suspended as indifferent
in its immediate reality; it is taken over as the medium of Truth. And
Greta is also not a creative genius but an apostle of a truth: she does
not bring forward some ingenious new insights; she just repeats the same
simple message again and again. Talking about politicians, she said: "We
have not taken to the streets for them to take selfies with us, and tell
us that they really, really admire what we do. We children are doing
this to wake the adults
up"[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1NT}[42](#part0014.xhtml#a1KV){.class_s1fz} --
this is how a true apostle talks, effacing herself from the picture
again and again, fully aware that the focus on her, even if it is
celebratory, works as a distraction from her message.
:::

::: class_s2s
It may appear that such a position of the apostle is the clearest case
of alienation: apostle is a subject who, in an act of radical
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_167}[kenosis]{.class_s1fv}, empties itself of
all self-expressive content in order to function as an impassive
transmitter of the big Other's message. However, one has to go through
this zero-point in order to discern the inconsistency and self-blockade
of this big Other itself, i.e., in order to bring out how the Truth
itself which speaks through me is non-all, traversed by an immanent
impossibility. When Greta calls us to listen to science and take it
seriously, this does not mean that science also provides the political
answers to what we are to do. Science enables us to discern the contours
of the deadlock in which we are (the catastrophic ecological
implications of our economic development, etc.), but there is no
"scientific politics" -- when we hear this slogan, we are right to
suspect the worst of manipulation and domination. Politics is subjective
in the most radical sense of the term, while science -- as Lacan put it
-- forecloses the dimension of subject. The science we should listen to
is not a neutral instrument of salvation but something we should
overcome, learn to think beyond its horizon. Greta is not a totalitarian
acting as an instrument of the scientific big Other, she is proposing
scientific data as the base which should compel us elaborate a new
emancipatory project and act upon it.
:::

::: class_s2s
This also means that we need a concept of alienation which reaches
beyond its Marxist version. So, to conclude, the parallel between
alienation in the signifier and the capitalist alienation of which Marx
speaks, alienation that pertains to commodity fetishism and the
appropriation of surplus-value, is misleading -- to simplify it to the
utmost, subject's alienation in the signifier is constitutive of the
subject, while capitalist alienation characterizes a certain
historically limited mode of production. (Although, for Marx, capitalism
is not just one among the modes of production but an exception which
functions as the symptomal point of entire history, and as such
universal in its meaning.) Alienation in the signifier and the
Unconscious will never be abolished as long as we are dealing with
subjectivity, while capitalism can be abolished, which is why the
parallel between [wo es war soll ich werden]{.class_s1fv} (the subject
appropriating its unconscious substance) and the proletarian struggle
against capital (and for the appropriation of social substance) misses
the key point. Communism is not an endless process of overcoming
capitalism, in the same way as
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_168}psychoanalysis never abolishes the
Unconscious: Communism, of course, will not be a perfect state of human
fulfilment, it will generate its own antagonisms, but they will be
qualitatively different from capitalist antagonisms. Plus they will not
mean that Communism is an endless unfinished project, a goal we will
never reach: Communism will be defined by these new antagonisms in
exactly the same way as capitalism is defined by its own specific
antagonisms.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1GY}[43](#part0014.xhtml#a1U0){.class_s1fz}

Marx's "Hegelian" scheme of a collective subject appropriating alienated
historical substance fails because it ignores the dimension of the
symbolic big Other: Marx's vision of a self-transparent society is the
vision of a society with no big Other. Marx does determine proletariat
as [substanzlose Subjektivitaet]{.class_s1fv}, but in his scheme,
substanceless subjectivity (a worker reduced to pure capacity-to-work
since all substantial content is taken away from him by the capital) is
reduced to a moment of extreme alienation which announces the
revolutionary reversal by means of which the collective subject will
re-appropriate its alienated substance. In Hegel and Lacan, on the
contrary, substanceless subject is subject as such, its constitutive
negativity, and the only way it can "overcome" its alienation from its
substance is to pass from alienation to separation, i.e., to perceive
itself as an effect of the crack, disparity, in the substance itself --
subject means that substance is already alienated from itself.

One can easily understand why Soviet tech-gnostics were dreaming about
something like Singularity -- Singularity may appear a caricatural
realization of Communism: all humans drowned in one great Mind, no
individuality, everything shared and transparent ... here we recall the
coded vision of Communism from the early 1950s science fiction paranoias
about the invasion of body snatchers. The invading aliens taking over
our bodies are portrayed like ants without individuality, totally
controlled by one central Mind. Singularity thus stands for utter
alienation of Subject in Substance, where this Substance loses its
mysterious transcendent character and becomes a field of transparency, a
god which is definitely not hidden. Singularity thus promises something
unthinkable within the classic Marxist universe: a social space which is
transparent, totally immanent, no longer haunted by an
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_169}alienated big Other. In short, in
Singularity, extreme alienation (of subject in substance) coincides with
the self-abolition of alienation.
:::

::: class_s2s
The prospect of Singularity opens up a unique chance of reasserting the
signifying alienation without the capitalist alienation. The paradox is
that, once we are dealing with the prospect of Singularity, the task of
liberation is no longer to abolish alienation -- in a perverted way this
will already be achieved in Singularity -- but, on the contrary, to
[re-establish alienation in the big Other as constitutive of
subjectivity]{.class_s1fv}. It is no longer to engage in the task of [wo
es war soll ich werden]{.class_s1fv}, of abolishing/appropriating the
Unconscious, but to open up the very space of the Unconscious threatened
by Singularity.

At a more general level, one should bear in mind that the prospect of
the wired brain fits perfectly the growing trend of indiscretion. Tyi
Starr, an Australian porn star, announced that she would sell a video of
her giving birth, claiming that she does not perceive her actions as
"wrong" and has no need to defend
them.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1UA}[44](#part0014.xhtml#a1T2){.class_s1fz} If
the wired brain will be developed on an individual basis (I decide who I
connect with), one can easily predict the next step: share my experience
of giving birth ... Some "radical" cis-feminists will probably celebrate
this gesture as a step towards "demystifying" the vagina, making us
aware that it is not just the ultimate object of sexual desire but also
has other functions -- however, one can also argue that Starr's gesture
does the exact opposite, i.e., that it sexualizes the act of giving
birth. Starr is right that there is nothing "wrong" with what she is
planning to do; one should only add that the standard hardcore depiction
of the sexual act to which we are all used is much more
shamelessly-intrusive than depicting the act of giving birth.
:::

::: class_s2s
Whatever our stance, the main thing is to keep in mind the growing trend
towards radical indiscretion that sustains Starr's act, and the
explosive potentials of this trend -- as Sloterdijk puts it: "More
communication means at first above all the more
conflict."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1GU}[45](#part0014.xhtml#a1GC){.class_s1fz}
This is why Sloterdijk is right to claim that the attitude of
"understanding-each-other" has to be supplemented by the attitude of
"getting-out-of-each-other's-way," by maintaining an appropriate
distance, by implementing a new "code of discretion." European
civilization finds it easier to tolerate different ways of life
precisely on account of what []{#part0013.xhtml#page_170}its critics
usually denounce as its weakness and failure, namely the alienation of
social life. One of the things alienation means is that distance is
included in the very social texture of everyday life: even if I live
side by side with others, in my normal state I ignore them. I am allowed
not to get too close to others. I move in a social space where I
interact with others obeying certain external "mechanical" rules,
without sharing their inner world. Perhaps the lesson to be learned is
that, sometimes, a dose of alienation is indispensable for the peaceful
coexistence of different ways of life. Sometimes
[alienation]{.class_s1fv} is not a problem but a solution, especially
when we are confronting the prospect of total indiscretion in
Singularity.
:::

::: class_s2s
Plus there is a further paradox at work here: since, in Singularity,
alienation brought to an extreme coincides with its own abolition, [the
only way to bring alienation back is through separation]{.class_s1fv} as
the operation which logically follows and counteracts alienation, i.e.,
through transposing the alienation of the subject from the big Other
into the big Other itself.

Will, then, the eventual rise of Singularity be the end of history, and
if yes, in what sense? The first thing to do before we tackle this
question is to distinguish between historicity proper and historicism.
The just outlined difference between the two modes of moving beyond
alienation -- separation and the simple humanist notion of
dis-alienation as a return to some kind of restored unity -- can be of
some help here insofar as it enables us to discern the danger of hasty
historicization. The difference that separates historicity proper from
mere historicism can also be captured by Lacan's "formulas of
sexuation." Historicism is clearly masculine: all social reality is
ultimately contingent, constructed in historically specific
circumstances, there are no trans-historical essentials, the basic form
of ideology is the eternalization of some historically specific content
... however, such a historicist approach exempts from the domain of
historical relativism its own stance which is silently universalized,
i.e., historicism applies the same notion of history to all historical
epochs.
:::

::: {#part0013.xhtml#page_171 .class_s2s}
We can discern this exception when we raise a simple question apropos
the anti-essentialist thesis that all forms of social identity are
contingent constructs: say, when proponents of gender theory claim that
every gender identity is a contingent historical construct, does this
apply in the same way to our late-capitalist societies as well as to
pre-historic tribal or hunter societies? If the answer is yes, then we
have to surmise that we live in a privileged era when the historical
contingency of every identity became obvious, i.e., we are caught
privileging our own epoch. In contrast to historicism, the basic feature
of authentic historicity is that it is feminine in the sense of Lacan's
formulas of sexuation: it abolishes this exception, i.e., it relativizes
its own position and thus historicizes its own notion of historicity. It
is in this sense that Hegel is a radical historicist: for him, with
every historical epoch, the universal notion of history also changes.
Such an approach thus allows for no exception to historicity and is for
this reason "non-all": there is no single universal notion of
historicity since this notion is itself caught in the process of
historical change.

So how does this distinction apply to the topic of historicizing our
basic notion of being-human? When Tupinamba deploys the implications of
the radical historicization of analytic clinics, he aptly refers to the
Kantian distinction between negative judgments (judgments that negate a
predicate, like "he is not dead") and infinite judgments (judgments that
assert a non-predicate, like "he is undead"). Along the same lines,
Tupinamba proposes the distinction between the negation of positive
universals and affirmation of negative universals:
:::

::: class_s2m
Considered only in its structural aspect, Freud's investigation could
simply seem like a negation of positive universals -- a movement that
unproblematically binds clinical practice and metapsychological theory
-- and therefore appears as a rather static process, concerning solely
the analyst and his subversive position. But what this picture is
missing is the essential dynamism through which the contradiction of
previously held universal claims enriches our understanding of how to
listen to new patients: a transformation of what is considered invariant
in the space of the possible, and therefore an affirmation of
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_172}negative universals -- more may vary in the
space of subjective solutions to sexuation than we previously
imagined.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1HT}[46](#part0014.xhtml#a1KC){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
While one should fully endorse this line of thought, one should just
give it a different reading. For Tupinamba, affirming negative
universals means simply that one should bring historicist relativization
to the end, widening the space of variations, while in my reading, such
relativization is already enacted in the "negation of positive
universals" which remains caught in what Hegel called "bad infinity": it
is "static" in its over-dynamization itself, a process that reached its
peak in "postmodern" historicist relativism. Every positive universality
is "deconstructed," it is demonstrated how its universality is biased,
how it secretly privileges and eternalizes a content which is a
contingent historical variable. But we should always bear in mind that
historicization can also be ideology, not only because it applies a
procedure of historicization (clearly grounded in our time) to all
epochs, but, more importantly, when it reduces to a historical variable
a basic feature of a certain domain.
:::

::: class_s2s
Along these lines, Fredric Jameson rejected the (once fashionable)
notion of "alternate modernities," i.e., the claim that our Western
liberal-capitalist modernity is just one of the paths to modernization,
and that other paths are possible which could avoid the deadlocks and
antagonism of our modernity: once we realize that "modernity" is
ultimately a code name for capitalism, it is easy to see that such
historicist relativization of our modernity is sustained by the
ideological dream of a capitalism which would avoid its constitutive
antagonisms -- was Fascism not the exemplary case of alternate
modernity? In a strictly homologous way, the reduction of the impasses
of sexuality to a specific historical constellation (say, of Western
patriarchy) opens up the space for the utopia of a full sexuality
without its impasses and perversions which, as Freud demonstrated,
inhabit its very notion. The way out of this ideological deadlock is to
supplement the negation of positive universals with the assertion of
negative universals, i.e., with an impossibility constitutive of the
entire domain: yes, all positive universals are relative, unstable; they
can be transformed, but not simply because of the dynamic and changeable
form of reality. Positive formations are so many attempts to deal with
the []{#part0013.xhtml#page_173}same underlying antagonism, and what
triggers change is the ultimate failure of every attempt to resolve this
antagonism. One of Lacan's negative universals is "there is no sexual
relationship," which means that it is not enough to point out the
immanent instability and historical character of the traditional gender
binary -- one should also add that every determinate form of gender
relationship, no matter how open and flexible it is, will fail to
overcome the impossibility constitutive of human sexuality.
:::

::: class_s2s
It is thus crucial to keep in view how ideological limitation works in
two opposed directions. Ideology is not only the eternalization of a
specific historical situation; it is also the reduction to a specific
contingent property of something that is constitutive of the entire
field. Ideology is not only the elevation of capitalism into the most
appropriate and rational economic order; it is also the dismissal of
crises and antagonisms that characterize capitalism into a deviation due
to particular contingent circumstances, and the accompanying idea that
another capitalism is possible which would avoid crises and antagonisms.
And this distinction also has important implications for any attempt to
try to understand how the fact of a wired brain will affect us: it will
not only compel us to historicize our form of subjectivity; it will also
compel us to resist the temptation to imagine simply a different form of
awareness akin to the dream of alternate modernity -- as if we will get
with a wired brain the same awareness we have now, just freed from the
constraints of finitude, i.e., as if post-humanity will be just a
humanity expanded and raised to a higher level.
:::

::: class_s2s
We can see now why the prospect of Singularity is today's main candidate
for the end of history: after it will take place, the rest will not be
history -- at least not history as we knew it and experienced it. This
brings us yet again back to the Hegelian territory, since Hegel is
[the]{.class_s1fv} philosopher of the end of history -- however, the end
of history in Singularity cannot but appear as something totally
different from Hegel's notion of this end. Can we then learn something
about it from Hegel? Maybe, we should begin with an aporia in the very
heart of Hegel's notion of the end of history.
:::

::: class_s2s
Historicizing his own position remains a problem for Hegel -- it is as
if he lacks the proper terms to formulate it. While he insists on the
closure of Absolute Knowing (AK), he often adds a weird
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_174}temporal qualification: "for the time
being," or something similar. So how is AK historicized? Can Hegel think
the historical limitation of his own position? In some sense, the answer
is no, of course: historicization of one's own position implies that we
can somehow step on our shoulders and look at ourselves from the
outside, so that we can see our own relativity, so AK is the necessary
consequence of radical self-historicization. However, to put it in a
brutally naïve way: does Hegel's logic really provide the definitive
(and in this sense ahistorical) matrix of all possible modes of
rationality? Does quantum physics not require a set of categories not
found in Hegel? So what should we do today, just continue relying on the
structure of Hegel's logic or rewrite it, introducing new categories? In
a critical stab at my position on this topic, MacGowan writes that
Hegel's claim about the end of history
:::

::: class_s2m
is stronger than an admission that the end of history constantly imposes
itself on us as historical subjects. Instead, Hegel believes we will
never move beyond the recognition that all are free, which is the
recognition that occurs in modern Europe (as well as in North America
and Haiti). This does not mean that significant historical events will
cease or that no new avenues for the articulation of freedom will be
discovered -- like some new form of communism, for instance. But, for
Hegel, history as a field for the unfolding of new insights into
existence reaches its conclusion with the recognition of universal
freedom, which occurs with the development of modernity and the French
Revolution.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1JG}[47](#part0014.xhtml#a1UJ){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
But is the assertion of universal freedom in modernity really a break
that "no subsequent event can ever
top"?[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1VW}[48](#part0014.xhtml#a1TV){.class_s1fz} One
can argue that it is rather the middle term in the triad of
Christianity, modern political freedom and what Communism envisages as
social freedom. We begin with the inner spiritual liberation (we are all
equal in Christ), we pass to political liberation (freedom in the
political public space), and after that, the prospect of a social
liberation opens up. In spite of all that is problematic in Marx's
dealing with freedom, he made a valuable point with his claim that the
market economy combines in a unique way political and personal freedom
with social unfreedom: personal freedom (freely
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_175}selling myself on the market) is the very
form of my unfreedom. This does not mean that political freedom is just
a bourgeois illusion masking the reality of exploitation and servitude
-- the problem is much more serious.
:::

::: class_s2s
In the aftermath of the French Revolution, new forms of mastery and
domination have appeared for which there is simply no place within the
established coordinates of Hegel's political thought: while there is a
place in Hegel for bloody tyrants who follow their private interests,
there is no place for evil embedded in state machinery itself and
performed by faithful administrators; there is no place for
democratically elected populist charismatic leaders gaining votes by way
of openly displaying their obscenity.
:::

::: class_s2s
While, in a market economy, I remain de facto dependent, this dependency
is nonetheless "civilized," enacted in the form of a "free" market
exchange between me and other persons instead of the form of direct
servitude or even physical coercion. It is easy to ridicule Ayn Rand,
but there is a grain of truth in the famous "hymn to money" from her
[Atlas Shrugged]{.class_s1fv}: "Until and unless you discover that money
is the root of all good, you ask for your own destruction. When money
ceases to become the means by which men deal with one another, then men
become the tools of other men. Blood, whips and guns or dollars. Take
your choice -- there is no
other."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1TT}[49](#part0014.xhtml#a1J9){.class_s1fz}
Did Marx not say something similar in his well-known formula of how, in
the universe of commodities, "relations between people assume the guise
of relations among things"? In the market economy, relations between
people can appear as relations of mutually recognized freedom and
equality: domination is no longer directly enacted and visible as such.
Really-existing Socialism in the twentieth century proved that the
overcoming of the market-alienation abolishes "alienated" freedom and
with it freedom tout court, bringing us back to "non-alienated"
relations of direct domination. How to imagine a communal space without
a regulating agency which controls the very medium of collaboration and
thereby exerts direct domination? It is thus clear that that a
"Communist" society would involve new "contradictions" -- can we surmise
what they would be? Fredric Jameson fearlessly proposed envy as the main
candidate.
:::

::: class_s2s
And we should apply Marx's axiom that a social formation is ultimately
defined by its founding "contradiction" (and by how it
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_176}tries to cope with it) also to a
post-capitalist society -- and also to the prospect of a society in
which wired brains play an important role. Instead of trying to imagine
distinct alternate options (a society deprived of human individuals; a
society of happy shared experiences), we should focus on the new
"contradiction" that will emerge. Will then, if we do enter Singularity,
the universe of meaning, the symbolic dimension, still be there or will
it disappear as if it never existed? Neither of the two: it will
disappear, but its disappearance will continue to be felt as an absence.
In short, it will function as an absential of Singularity. The irony is
that subject will survive as the absential, embodying the very dimension
(of differentiality) that, as we can presume, will escape Singularity.
:::

::: class_s2s
This is how we should deal with the key alternative here: even if the
subject's Unconscious in principle eludes the grasp of Singularity, what
if this does not mean that there will be a dimension which will elude
Singularity but something much more simple and radical: the subject will
pay its entry into Singularity by simply [losing the dimension of the
Unconscious]{.class_s1fv}? In short, what if its immersion in
Singularity will preclude the dimension of the Unconscious, leaving no
space for it? What if this immersion means that the scope of
subjectivity will be limited to what is registered by Singularity? This
will not be the case because the very disappearance of the symbolic loss
("Fall") will continue to echo in the space of Singularity.
:::

::: class_s2s
Furthermore, with our entry into Singularity, will the very space of the
Hegelian dialectics of recognition not disappear? The "testing" of two
subjects when they confront each other becomes pointless when the
intimate self-experience of each of them is directly accessible to
other(s) ... One can nonetheless venture the hypothesis that, insofar as
the subject of the Unconscious survives at a distance from the shared
space of Singularity, a new space of recognition opens up in which this
very status of subject is at stake: in a new "fight to the death" I have
to prove that I cannot be reduced to my place in Singularity ...
:::

::: class_s2s
The distance between our inner life, the line of our thoughts, and
external reality is the basis of the perception of ourselves as free: we
are free in our thoughts precisely insofar as they are at a distance
from reality, so that we can play with them, make thought-experiments,
engage in dreaming, with no direct
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_177}consequences in reality, no one can control
us there. Once our inner life is directly linked to reality so that our
thoughts have direct consequences in reality (or can be directly
regulated by a machine that is part of reality) and are in this sense no
longer "ours," we effectively enter a post-human state. The subject that
will survive will thus not be the bearer of the wealth of inner
experience -- all that wealth of feelings, passions, fears, dreams and
hopes, etc., could well be drowned in the collective space of
Singularity. The subject will survive as a pure \$, the vanishing point
of negativity separated from all of its experienced content. In short,
the subject will be divided more than ever, divided not between itself
and its other(s) but divided in itself, between its content (separated
from it) and the punctuality of \$ (barred zero-point of subjectivity).
:::

::: class_s2s
This punctual status of [cogito]{.class_s1fv} becomes clear only later,
with its Kantian reformulation. The Kantian Self-Consciousness is a
purely logical function which signals only that every content of my
consciousness is already minimally mediated/reflected: when I desire X,
I can never say "I am simply like that, I cannot help desiring X, it's
part of my nature," since, I always desire to desire X, i.e. I
reflectively accept my desire for X -- all reasons which motivate me to
act exert their causal power only insofar as I "posit" or accept them as
reasons ... One would think such implicit reflexivity is limited to
conscious activity and is, as such, precisely that which our unconscious
acts lack -- when I act unconsciously, I act as if I follow a blind
compulsion, as if I am submitted to a pseudo-natural causality. However,
as we have already seen apropos the role of absentials, implicit
reflexivity is for Lacan not only also discernible in the unconscious,
it is precisely that which, at its most radical, [is]{.class_s1fv}
unconscious. Let us recall the typical attitude of a hysterical subject
who complains how he is exploited, manipulated, victimized by others,
reduced to an object of exchange -- Lacan's answer to this is that this
subjective position of a passive victim of circumstances is never simply
imposed from outside onto the subject but has to be at least minimally
endorsed by him. The subject, of course, is not aware of his active
participation in his own victimization -- this, precisely, is the
"unconscious" truth of the subject's conscious experience of being a
mere passive victim of circumstances.
:::

::: {#part0013.xhtml#page_178 .class_s2s}
One can see now in what precise psychoanalytical context Lacan's
apparently nonsensical thesis according to which the Cartesian
[cogito]{.class_s1fv} (or, rather, the Kantian Self-Consciousness) is
the very subject of the Unconscious, is grounded: for Lacan, the
"subject of the unconscious," the subject to be attributed to the
Freudian Unconscious, is precisely this empty point of self-relating,
not a subject bursting with a wealth of libidinal forces and fantasies.
This paradoxical identity of Self-Consciousness (in the precise sense
that this term acquires in German Idealism) with the subject of the
Unconscious becomes clear in the problematic of radical Evil, from Kant
to Schelling: faced with the enigma of how it is that we hold an evil
person responsible for his deeds (although it is clear to us that the
propensity to Evil is part of this person's "nature," i.e. that he
cannot but "follow his nature" and accomplish his deeds with an absolute
necessity), Kant and Schelling postulate a non-phenomenal
transcendental, atemporal act of primordial choice, by means of which,
each of us, prior to his temporal bodily existence, choses his eternal
character. Within our temporal phenomenal existence, this act of choice
is experienced as an imposed necessity, which means that the subject, in
his phenomenal self-awareness, is not conscious of the free choice which
grounds his character (his ethical "nature") -- that is to say, this act
is radically unconscious (the conclusion explicitly drawn by Schelling).
We encounter here again the subject as the void of pure reflectivity, as
that X to which one can attribute (as his free decision) what, in our
phenomenal self-awareness, one experiences as part of our inherited or
otherwise imposed nature. The conclusion to be drawn is thus, again,
that Self-Consciousness itself is radically unconscious.
:::

::: class_s2s
The standard topic of the contemporary anti-philosophy is
anti-Cartesianism: the Cartesian [cogito]{.class_s1fv} is an abstract
rational entity artificially torn out of the concrete life-world of
actual individuals. In this context, the Freudian Unconscious is
perceived as part of the anti-Cartesian backlash, as yet another proof,
in the line of Feuerbach, Marx, etc., that we humans are not isolated
thinking beings but, as Heidegger would have put it, always-already
thrown-into-the-world, engaged with reality. Lacan's thesis that
[cogito]{.class_s1fv} is the Freudian subject acquires here its full
weight: for him, on the contrary, the Unconscious is not part of the
thick non-transparent []{#part0013.xhtml#page_179}background of the
[Lebenswelt]{.class_s1fv}. With regard to the opposition between
abstract (decontextualized) rational structures and concrete thick
life-world, the Unconscious is on the side of the first: the Unconscious
is the intrusion of a foreign body into our life-world, it is like an
intruding machine which derails the smooth functioning of our
life-world, subordinating it to its own weird laws. Just think about
what the Unconscious of drives does to our innate instinctual sexuality:
it totally perverts it, subordinating its reproductive function to an
almost suicidal mechanism of the compulsion-to-repeat in which enjoyment
is posited as a self-goal. So, to conclude, let's recall how MacGowan
resumes the basic political lesson of Hegel's dialectics:
:::

::: class_s2m
The point of political contestation is to move in the direction of an
increasingly resistant contradiction, and philosophy plays a vital role
in this movement. This is Hegel's definition of progress: the movement
from more easily resolved social contradictions to more intractable
ones.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1J1}[50](#part0014.xhtml#a1WU){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2p
In short, in a Hegelian reconciliation, the opposing forces of a
conflict are not reunited in a higher non-antagonistic Whole; a Hegelian
reconciliation is, at its most radical, the reconciliation with
"contradiction" itself. In the concluding moment of a dialectical
circular move, the contradiction that motivated this move is not
abolished; it re-emerges in its purest and more radical form. Or, to use
the standard terms never used by Hegel himself, in the final "synthesis"
the anti-thesis is brought to an extreme, fully internalized as
constitutive of the entity in question. (We should not be afraid to
apply this on Marx's notion of Communism: if the entire hitherto history
is the history of class struggle, in Communism, "struggle" will erupt in
a more radical form.) And does the prospect of Singularity not provide
the ultimate example of this process? It will not be the immersion in a
selfless collective thought but the experience of a radical gap or,
rather, split: the subject will maintain a minimum of distance towards
the collective thought, and this distance will be the source of a
suffering whose contours we cannot guess today, but also the source of a
new hope.
:::

::: class_s2s
The answer to the question "will a subject survive the entry into
Singularity?" does depend on our notion of subject. If we identify
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_180}as the core of subjectivity its "inner
life," what we usually refer to as the inner wealth of a personality,
its secret dreams, anxieties and hopes, then, of course, subject
disappears in Singularity where all such content is "collectivized." If,
however, we identify subject as the void filled in by what Lacan refers
to as the fantasmatic "stuff of the I" but not identical to it, then it
is only in the passage through Singularity that a subject appears as
reduced to its minimum, as the void of the Cartesian
[cogito]{.class_s1fv}. The loss of the loss itself, the appearance of
the loss at its purest, is therefore something like a thinking version
of Malevitch's famous black square on a white surface: the zero-level,
the marking of the basic coordinates of our symbolic space. It is
important to note here that, for Malevitch, this zero-form is not some
kind of self-destructive abyss we should beware of not being swallowed
by it but a point through which we should pass to gain a new beginning.
It is the moment of death-drive which opens up the space for a new
beginning. This is why Malevitch's later more figurative paintings (like
his famous self-portrait) are not a betrayal of his youthful radicality
but ways to explore the space opened up by it. (In the self-portrait,
this fidelity is signaled by Malevitch's hands forming a square, telling
the viewer that the square is still here.) And the same goes for our
entry into Singularity: the loss of a loss brought by it could be a new
beginning of something we cannot yet imagine.

So what will survive in Singularity, what will elude its space of shared
collective experience? Two interdependent (non-)entities: the empty
subject, a subject deprived of the wealth of its inner life, and its
correlate, the virtual Unconscious. (Plus, if we follow our Beckettian
speculation, the division between empty subject and the estranged
thought-content of its inner life -- the selfless collective thought the
subject will no longer experience as "its own" -- will inscribe itself
into this thought itself as the division between hallucinatory
collective trance and cold objective knowledge.) The persistence of the
virtual Unconscious means that the empty subject will not be just a mute
singular point at a distance from the collective substance of
Singularity: the collective space of Singularity will be experienced as
fractured, inconsistent, with another voice, the voice of unconscious
counterfactuals, appearing in its
cracks.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1W8}[51](#part0014.xhtml#a1H0){.class_s1fz}

::: {#part0013.xhtml#page_181 .class_s2s}
In other words, what survives entry into Singularity is not the core of
being-human but precisely the inhuman part or aspect of humanity, the
Cartesian subject and the Unconscious. Descartes was the first
anti-humanist thinker: his [cogito]{.class_s1fv} should be strictly
distinguished from what we call "human personality," all the wealth of
inner life. The high epoch of humanism was the Renaissance which
celebrates human beings as the highest among all creatures, as a
creature of expressivity creatively bringing out its inner depth,
deploying its inner potentials. The Cartesian subject is quite another
thing: an inhuman void, an empty point of self-relating negativity. What
effectively is under threat from the wired brain is our ordinary
self-experience as free human individuals with direct access to our
inner life, but this threat, this dispossession of what we, in our daily
life, consider the staple of our personality, brings out the contours of
our inhuman subjectivity.
:::

::: class_s2s
So we should now, as in the final punchline of a joke, turn around our
repeatedly raised question: will the eventual rise of a wired brain
threaten the core of our being-human? We should replace it with the
opposite question: will this eventual rise produce a new form of
subjectivity? Will it render palpable a key dimension of subjectivity
which, until now, has been obfuscated in our self-experience? Our answer
is a cautious yes: what will become visible is the gap that separates
the void of subjectivity from the so-called "inner world" of our
personality, the gap that is invisible in our daily experience where we
identify ourselves with our "inner life."
:::

::: class_s2s
This interconnection between the Cartesian subject and the Unconscious
has two further crucial implications. First, even this "pure" subject
(which survives the entry into Singularity) is not without object, it is
constitutively correlated with an "impossible" object, what Lacan calls
object small a. Second, this "pure" subject is also not neutral with
regard to sexual difference but is constitutively sexed, traversed by
the real of the impossibility of sexual relationship: subject is only
subject insofar as it is curtailed (truncated, inhibited) by this
impossibility, not neutral but always "partial" with regard to the
choice imposed by sexual difference. Yes, subject is not object, it
persists only insofar as it eludes any identification with some object;
however, in the same way there is a difference between
coffee-without-milk and plain coffee as
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_182}coffee-without, a subject can be a subject
without a determinate phallic object (male castration), or a subject
which is just without (feminine). Or, to put it in a different way,
while men sacrifice themselves for something (a higher cause: country,
freedom, honor), only women are able to sacrifice themselves for
[nothing]{.class_s1fv}.
:::

::: class_s2s
This paradox accounts for the gesture of feminine withdrawal at the very
moment when "she could have it all (the longed-for partner)" in a series
of novels from Madame de Lafayette's [Princesse de Cleves]{.class_s1fv}
to Goethe's [Elective Affinities]{.class_s1fv} (or, the
obverse/complementary case, the woman's non-withdrawal, her inexplicable
perseverance in the unhappy marriage, or with a no longer loved partner,
even when the possibility arises to get out of it, as in James's [The
Portrait of a Lady]{.class_s1fv}). Although ideology gets invested in
this gesture of renunciation, the gesture itself is non-ideological. The
reading of this gesture to be rejected is the standard psychoanalytic
one according to which we are dealing with the hysterical logic of the
object of love (the lover) who is desired only insofar as he is
prohibited, only insofar as there is an obstacle in the guise of the
husband -- the moment the obstacle disappears, the woman loses interest
in this love object. In addition to the hysterical economy of being able
to enjoy the object only insofar as it remains illicit/prohibited,
insofar as it maintains a potential status, i.e. in the guise of
fantasies about what "might have" happened, this withdrawal (or
insistence) can also be interpreted in a multitude of other ways: as the
expression of so-called "feminine masochism" (which can be further read
as an expression of the eternal feminine nature, or as the
internalization of the patriarchal pressure) preventing a woman to fully
"seize the day"; as a proto-feminist gesture of stepping out of the
confines of phallic economy which posits as the woman's ultimate goal
her happiness in a relationship with a man; etc. etc. However, all these
interpretations seem to miss the point which consists in the absolutely
fundamental nature of the gesture of withdrawal as constitutive of the
subject herself. If, following the great German Idealists, we equate
subject with freedom and autonomy, is such a gesture of withdrawal --
not as a sacrificial gesture addressed at some version of the big Other,
but as a gesture which provides its own satisfaction, as a gesture of
finding [jouissance]{.class_s1fv} in the very gap that separates me from
the object -- not the ultimate form of autonomy?
:::

::: {#part0013.xhtml#page_183 .class_s2s}
Back to our example of coffee without milk: if men are like coffee with
milk/penis, women are not man without milk/penis, but they are also not
just fully women. This is what Lacan aims at with his claim that [la
femme n'existe pas]{.class_s1fv}: although a woman is not defined by the
negation of being-man, there is no substantial feminine identity. In his
seminar on feminine sexuality, Lacan claims that, while man can be
defined differentially, as not-woman, the obverse does not hold: woman
cannot be defined as not-man. This does not mean that women possess a
substantial identity outside relation to man: what characterizes a woman
prior to the relation to man is rather a [no]{.class_s1fv} as such, a
self-relating negativity, and man as not-woman means that man, in its
very being, denies the [no]{.class_s1fv} itself that defines feminine
subjectivity, not that it negates some substantial feminine essence.
Homologously, the status of "coffee without milk" implies that there is
no simple positive "plain coffee" lacking nothing: "plain coffee"
without a without is already in itself marked by negation, it is just
that this negation is not yet a determinate negation.
:::

::: class_s2s
With regard to the triad of man, woman, and human, one should bear in
mind that both woman and human combine "man" with a prefix: "woman"
joins "wife" (wife, female person) to man, so that it means something
like "wife-man," and "human" means "of or belonging to
man."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1TS}[52](#part0014.xhtml#a1T9){.class_s1fz} One
should thus reject the common notion that the genus of humans is divided
into species of men and women: the underlying logic is more that of the
genus "men" divided into species "humans" and "women" since "hu (of)"
and "wo (wife)" are the two specifications of "man." There are men who
are fully human, "of man," and there are men who are obviously not fully
"of man," and the prefix "wo" indexes this deprivation. So what should
the feminist answer to this distortion be? Not, as it may appear, to
essentialize femininity as a generic term and to reduce "man" to its
deficient species, but rather to elevate deficiency itself into a basic
constitutive feature of being-human, and to conceive the masculine
position as an obfuscation of this constitutive deficiency.
:::

::: class_s2s
It is this constitutive deficiency which is threatened by the wired
brain -- when my brain is wired, I no longer need to make external
bodily movements (typing, talking) to interact with the machine.
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_184}This fact radically changes the status of
the interface defined as "a shared boundary across which two or more
separate components of a computer system exchange information. The
exchange can be between software, computer hardware, peripheral devices,
humans, and combinations of
these."[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1GD}[53](#part0014.xhtml#a1J4){.class_s1fz}
With projects like the already-mentioned AlterEgo, the interface which
enables me to communicate with the machine is no longer a screen outside
me: [my mind directly functions as the interface between me and the
machine]{.class_s1fv}. I have thus in principle no place to hide, no
distance from machine: I am thoroughly exposed to the
machine.[]{#part0013.xhtml#a1WH}[54](#part0014.xhtml#a1J5){.class_s1fz}
:::

::: class_s2s
To clarify this point, let's make a detour and elevate into a concept
the notion of "glory hole" (a hole in a wall, or other partition, often
between public lavatory cubicles or adult video arcade booths and
lounges, for people to engage in sexual activity). Although glory holes
are mostly associated with gay culture and anal or oral sex, they are
also used by bisexual or heterosexual people -- large holes into which a
woman can put the lower half of her body in order to get penetrated
anonymously. The function of a glory hole is double: it maintains the
anonymity of the partners of sexual exchange, plus it depersonalizes my
partner, reducing him/her to a partial object (I only play with penis
with testicles, anal opening, or vagina). Some queer theorists point out
the liberating aspect of such depersonalization; however, one should
insist here on the distinction between person and subject: while such
anonymous sex depersonalizes (deprives my partner of his/her status as a
personality), it does NOT deprive him/her of subjectivity -- it
precisely reduces the other to a pure subject deprived of his/her
personality. When I engage in a sexual activity through a glory hole, I
acquire a kind of distance from what goes on on the other side of the
hole, I am not fully in it, I am reduced to an empty observer of what
goes on out there, and this distance sets me free from my personality
and reduces me to a subject. For a Lacanian, it is easy to see the link
between this depersonalization and the reduction of the body to a
partial organ which enjoys through the hole: a person is a correlate to
the entire body, it is like the soul, the inner wealth of a body, while
subject is correlated to a partial object -- or, as Lacan wrote it in
his formula of the fantasy, \$ -- [a]{.class_s1fv}. The wall in which
the glory hole gapes is thus the wall that
[]{#part0013.xhtml#page_185}separates person from subject: let's say I
am the one who pushes my penis and testicles through the hole so that
the one on the other side can play with it -- on this (my) side of the
wall I am a person with a body, on the other side I am a subject
appended to a partial organ my anonymous partner is playing with
(masturbating or sucking it, pushing it into his/her anus or vagina
...). The paradox here is that my "true self" is not this side of the
hole, while on the other side I only play a game -- on the contrary, the
fantasmatic core of my subjectivity is out there on the other side, so
that in some sense I am more "truly myself" in the sexual interplay that
goes on out there (and where I am reduced to a partial object) than I am
as a person this side of the wall. In this precise sense, we can also
say that the hole is an interface of the two different dimensions, my
reality on this side and the fantasmatic real on the other side. The key
feature of glory holes is the wall which functions as the frontier
separating two different spaces, my personal reality and the real on the
other side where I play out my fantasies. Glory holes here just provide
a particular case of the division which is at work in every form of
reality -- reality is never "all," it is always curtailed by some form
of a wall that excludes from it the real. With regard to our topic --
wired brain in which my mind itself directly serves as the interface --
the question is, of course: what happens in this case when there is no
wall separating my reality from the fantasmatic real? There is only one
answer: a kind of psychotic short-circuit in which reality and fantasy
directly coincide -- another dystopian vision of a catastrophe...

However, as we have already seen, this is not the whole story. Back to
Musk's idea that, if we don't join the supermind of the new Artificial
Intelligence, we -- humans -- will soon become like gorillas in a zoo:
but what if this prospect of somehow remaining-outside has its own
advantages? Not in the sense that we'll enjoy a new stupid ignorant
existence in our zoo, being taken care of by the benevolent AI, but in a
much more radical sense: if we assume that the eventual space of
Singularity will not be an omnipotent single space controlling it all
but an inconsistent mixture, will our (partial) exclusion from it not
provide for a minimum of freedom, of playing with different aspects of
the multifaceted Singularity? In a joke about Auschwitz that circulates
among Jews, a group of them who []{#part0013.xhtml#page_186}were burned
in the camp sit at a bench in Paradise and talk about their suffering,
making fun of it. One of them says: "David, you remember how you slipped
on the way to the gas chamber and died before the gas even engulfed
you?", etc. Strolling around in Paradise, god himself comes by, listens
to them and complains that he doesn't get the joke; one of the Jews
steps towards him, puts a hand on his shoulder and comforts him: "Don't
be sad. You were not there, so of course you cannot get the joke!" The
beauty of this reply resides in the way it refers to the well-known
statement that god died in Auschwitz, that there was no god there: "no
god in Auschwitz" does not imply that god cannot understand the horror
of what went on there (god can do that easily, it's his job to do it),
but that he cannot understand the humor generated by the experience of
Auschwitz. What god doesn't (and cannot) get is the obscene sovereignty
of the human spirit which reacts with laughter to the very space where
he (god) is absent. Replace god with Singularity and, maybe, this is our
position in Singularity.
