## CHAPTER XIII
## The Idea in Nature
 

 

We have in the logical Idea the pure inner thought of the world. But the truth of this entails that it go over not just in inner necessity but in reality into a world. And hence the Logic ends by deducing the fact of nature. In other words we have just shown that everything emanates from an inner necessity and thus that Being is self-related as a totality, and hence immediate. But this as Hegel says, is no transition, or becoming; it is not like the moving from a less perfect to the more perfect form. These transitions were between levels within the totality. Here we have nothing but the totality itself as we have already shown it to be.

The point is that real self-subsistent necessity has to inhere in an independent reality. It must be a free necessity, that is, must emanate from the reality itself as its own. And this means that there must be a free self-subsisting being which has its own necessity. Hence says Hegel the freedom of the Idea entails that it ‘leaves itself free’ (WL, II, 505); that it must issue in, be a reality which is not held in the lead strings of the Idea as an external source of control, but which itself has this necessity. But to be is to be determinate. Determinancy implies that things are really external to each other; and this means that they exist in space and time.

Hence this existent totality in space and time must be what has the necessity in itself. Freedom, that is, self-necessitation of the real, since the real requires existence in time and space, implies a totality in time and space which secretes its own necessity, whose necessity is not external to it, as it still was in the forms of subjective concept, and cognition. Thus the very attainment of the Idea as the fullness of internal necessity, requires that this be fully external. The fully inner is the fully outer; in both good and bad sense these coincide, as we saw.

Thus there is really no transition here but an equivalence. The Idea leaves itself free, as we saw. ‘Because of this freedom the form of its determinateness is also completely free – the externality of space and time existing absolutely on its own without subjectivity’ (WL, II, 505).

The underlying image here is that a subjectivity before a world without inner necessity can only retain necessary order by thinking the world himself. He must perpetually watch it and keep it in the tutelage of his thought lest it fall into mere contingency. But if we are really dealing with free necessity, then the world can be left free, and will exhibit this order itself. So the freedom of the Idea entails that it ‘resolves to let the moment of its particularity, of its first determination and other-being, the immediate Idea as its reflection, to let itself as nature go forth freely from itself’. (EL, § 244.)

Nature thus issues from the Idea. This is the starting point of the philosophy of nature and the entire set of dependent, interpretative dialectics which make up the philosophy of spirit. We cannot unfortunately follow them all here. In the Encydopaedia, which Hegel published in 1817 and which went through three editions before his death, Hegel lays out his whole system in compact form. The Logic is succeeded by the Philosophy of Nature, and this in turn by the Philosophy of Spirit, which in a sense completes the triad by mediating the Idea and Nature.

The Philosophy of Spirit is itself divided into three parts. The first, Subjective Spirit, deals with what can roughly be called psychology and man’s powers as a thinking (individual) being. The second, Objective Spirit, deals with spirit as embodied in human society, and is Hegel’s philosophy of history and politics. The third, Absolute Spirit, touches on the absolute’s knowledge of itself, as couched in the three great media of art, religion and philosophy.

The latter two parts were of course the object of other works of Hegel’s mature years, the Philosophy of Right, which he published himelf, and the lectures on the philosophy of history, aesthetics, philosophy of religion and history of philosophy, the notes for which were published shortly after his death. These were the domains of Hegel’s richest interpretative dialectics, about which he thought deepest and in which his originality came most to the fore. We shall take them up in the next two parts.

Hegel’s philosophy of nature was a somewhat more derivative work. He drew greatly on the earlier speculations of Schelling and the Romantics. We saw in the first chapter how the idea of a poetic physics, which would show traces of the divine in nature, greatly excited the Romantics. And it was a preoccupation which they shared with Goethe. Hegel, off on his own eccentric path in the 1790s, seems to have come late to this preoccupation.1 He was concerned rather with the religious history and destiny of man. Schelling was the philosopher who cashed in on this vogue of spiritualized physics, as it were, and supplied the philosophical vision of nature the age hungered for.

Hegel’s first steps in philosophy of nature were taken under the influence of Schelling. But his own system required a philosophy of nature. For all being issued from the Idea, and it must be possible to show this by examining reality at all levels. Hegel’s final philosophy of nature is thus a transposition of Schelling’s in which the structures of the Idea, as Hegel understood them, are shown to be embodied in the natural world.2

The philosophy of nature is therefore really what we called a hermeneutical dialectic. Hegel would probably not like this term, with its implication that final certainty always eludes us. But it is in any case clear that this dialectic is a dependent one. It does not start from an undeniable point of departure and move thence by strict argument. Rather it presupposes what has been proven in the Logic, and also what has been shown by natural science and shows how one reflects the other. Rather than a proof, it provides an exposition of the agreement of nature with the Idea.

The philosophy of nature thus comes after natural science and must agree with it. Or as Hegel puts it

It is not only that philosophy must accord with the experience nature gives rise to; in its formation and in its development, philosophic science presupposes and is conditioned by empirical physics.

(EN, § 246, Remark)3

But at the same time, it must seize the inner necessity of nature. It sees nature in ‘its own inner necessity according to the self-determination of the Concept’ (EN, § 246).

Necessity belongs to the Concept. We have to show its traces in nature, and this presupposes the empirical results of natural science. But it is not an appeal to experience, for the structure of necessity comes from the Concept. We deduce its stages and then recognize them in empirical nature. Hegel reminds us that

in the course of philosophical knowledge the object not only has to be presented in its determination according to the Concept, but the empirical appearance corresponding to this determination also has to be specified, and it has to be shown that the appearance does in fact correspond to this conceptual determination. But this is, in relation to the necessity of the content, not an appeal to experience.(EN § 246, Remark)

Later on, he says that natural philosophy takes the stuff that physics prepares for it out of experience at the point where physics has brought it, ‘and reconstitutes it’ (und bildet ihn wieder um, EN, § 246, Addition, p. 44). It gives the findings of physics its form of necessity as something which ‘as an intrinsically necessary whole proceeds out of the Concept’ (loc. cit.).4

The trouble with the findings of physics as they are is that they lack this necessity. The universals are just formal, abstract, that is, without inner relation to their particular embodiment. Which means that they are also contingent, for they are discovered by examining this embodiment which is without inner relation to them. And so the determinate content is outside the universal ‘split up, dismembered, particularized, separated and lacking in any necessary connection within itself, and so is only finite’ (EN, § 246, Addition, p. 45)5

Our job is to take this back to unity. But here is where we run into a lot of resistance. Some believe that the universal, thought, the subject, is forever cut off from the particular existence, reality, the object. We can never pierce the veil. But in fact this absolute division is denied every day in our practical activity. Even animals have this intuition of the nothingness of what opposes us. Against those metaphysicians who claim that we cannot know things, ‘because they are absolutely fixed over against us’, we could say ‘that even animals are not as stupid as these metaphysicians, for they fall to and grab, seize and consume things’ (loc. cit. p. 42).

And in fact what underlies things is the Idea, the Idea in the Platonic sense, thought, the Universal. For this universal has to go out into existence, God has to create the world.

This is sensed by some. They see the world of abstract universals of physics as not satisfactory. But they despair of reason, and talk about reconstituting the unity of things through simple intuition. Hegel is here referring to the Romantics. They have a premonition of the universal, he says, but the appeal to intuition is an ‘impasse’ (Abweg, p. 46). For we must seize thought with thought. This kind of flight is also related to the phenomenon of primitivism.

The vocation of natural philosophy is to realize the goal of Geist to recognize himself in nature, to find there his ‘counterpart’ (Gegenbild). Geist has the certainty of Adam before Eve: ‘this is flesh of my flesh; and bone of my bone’ (loc. cit. p. 48).

Later Hegel says again that we must set up a comparison to see whether our definition of nature out of the concept ‘corresponds to our ordinary thinking about nature’ (der Vorstellung entspricht, EN, § 247, Addition, p. 51), for in general the two must agree.

Nature is the Idea in the form of other-being. It is not only external to the Idea, but is externality itself. (EN, § 247). God must go out and become other: As Idea, this is the Logos, the eternal son of God. He also goes out to finite Spirit, which is also Geist as ‘other-being’ (Anderssein). But Nature is the Idea, the son of God, as

abiding in otherness, in which the divine Idea is held fast for an instant outside of love. Nature is self-alienated spirit; spirit, a bacchantic god innocent of restraint and reflection has merely been let loose into it; in nature, the unity of the Concept conceals itself.(EN, § 247), Addition, p. 50)6

But estranged (entfremdet) from the Idea, ‘nature is merely the corpse of the understanding’. It is the Idea frozen or turned to stone. But this it cannot remain because God is subjectivity, infinite actuosity. (pp. 50–1).

Nature does not conform to its Idea. It is the ‘unresolved contradiction’. (EN, § 248, Remark.) Matter is that which is external to itself (EN, § 248, Addition, p. 56). So it is blind necessity, not yet freedom, necessity which is one with contingency. Because necessity is the relation of seeming independent entities, nature is not free, but necessary and contingent.

For necessity is the inseparability of terms which are different, and yet appear to be indifferent. The abstraction of self-externality also receives its due there however, hence the contingency or external necessity, contrasting with the inner necessity of the Concept.

(EN, § 248, Addition, pp. 56–7)7

Nature is a system of levels (Stufen) where each goes necessarily into a higher one. But the higher is not generated out of the lower. It is the work of the Concept. (EN, § 249). Hegel here refuses any truck with evolution. The only thing which can really develop is the Concept. Hence development exists in its manifestation in Geist, but not in nature. Nature is that which is external to itself; its principle is the Concept; but this is purely inner. ‘The Concept in a universal manner posits all particularity into existence at once.’ (EN, § 249, Addition, p. 59). The essence of Nature is exteriority, so that the differences which makes up its whole concept must fall outside each other as ‘indifferent existents’ (gleichgültige Existenzen, EN, § 249, Remark). The argument seems to be that if nature were to develop to the fullness of its required moments out of itself, to be first inorganic then organic, etc.; this would confer the power of the Concept in nature itself, for it would be able to unfold. But the concept is only innerly embodied in Geist, which thus alone has history.

This paragraph is disastrous. In the Addition, Hegel not only argues further against evolution, but also against understanding differences in a series, in which the higher are produced out of the lower recursively by some formula. Nature does make jumps, because the Concept moves by qualitative differences. Thus Hegel also rules out the periodic table, Mendeleyev as well as Darwin.

Because nature is just inner necessity, it has lots of contingency in it. Contingency is for Hegel the same as determination from outside. Particular concrete things are full of such contingency and determination from outside. This is ‘the impotence of nature that it only maintains the determinations of the Concept in an abstract manner and exposes the realization of the particular to determination from without’ (EN, § 250). This sets limits to what philosophy can deduce; and this is the answer to Herr Krug who asked natural philosophy to deduce his pen. We see in the particular only ‘traces of determination by the Concept’ (Spuren der Begriffsbestimmung, EN, § 250, Remark). This is why natural classes have lots of arbitrariness and disorder in them; not to speak of the problems created by monsters, etc.

There are three big stages. (EN, § 252). These were already adumbrated in the Objectivity section of the Logic. First we have nature thought of as mass. This is the sphere of mechanics, and its highest realization is the solar system. This reveals the form of Being-for-self (Fürsichsein) in this sphere in the form of a drive (Trieb) towards the centre. The system is ordered, and turns around a central point. But this form is still external matter; the different bodies which have different roles are indistinguishable in their substance, only differentiated in their role.

We thus go to the next stage, where the form-differences become internal to matter; and here we have matter differentiated into different kinds of substance. The different roles called for by the Concept in order to make ordered unity are in the matter itself. But this stage is still one of immediate unity of form with its matter. They are united just positively. A matter is identified with its quality. It is not an inner identity which posits this property. It ceases to be itself when it loses this property. In this way it is like the Dasein of the first book of the Logic.

But with the organic we have fürsichseiende Totality, which develops itself to its differences. The life of these differences is now gathered into a natural individual and becomes one with his inmost nature. So that this inner necessity is now outwardly expressed and is intrinsic to a natural being. Life will now multiply into separate totalities, not just properties. These are specimens and also members. But they are produced and held in relation by one process of life.

I

Mechanics starts with the derivation of space, time, matter and motion. Then the second chapter ‘Finite Mechanics’, deals with gravity. The third chapter ‘Astronomy’ deals with the realization of mechanics in order, the solar system. This is the ‘absolute mechanics’ of the Logic.

Space is exteriority itself; the first, abstract, basic determination of nature, that it is external to itself. It is homogeneous, yet interruptible at any point. As pure exteriority it has no inner differentiation. Hegel thus, like Kant, rejects both the classical theories. Space is not just a property of things, because it is there even if you take them away. But nor is it a substantial reality itself; it has no reality on its own. (EN, § 254, Addition). Kant is right in his own way that it is a simple form. But he is wrong as usual to think of this in a subjective manner. Space is not just subjective; but it is a form in the sense of a pure abstraction, the pure abstract reality of the natural, the external; hence it must be filled (EN, § 254, Remark). It is a ‘non-sensuous sensibility and a sensuous insensibility. The things of nature are in space, and as nature is subject to the condition of externality, space remains the foundation of nature’. (EN, § 254, Addition)8

Hegel also deduces the triplicity of dimensions from the Concept, and their lack of difference from the externality of this realization (EN, § 225).

But this immediate external existence has negativity in it because it cannot exist as just external, hence it is in contradiction. Hegel sees negation first in the point (EN, § 256), the attempt to get out of externality to singular self-identity. But the nature of space is such that this is a negation of it, to have no extension, so the point goes into the line, the line into the surface, and this into the whole space.

But this negativity has real existence as time. So space is no longer at rest, its parts just coexisting. Now it is in movement. Time is the side of Nothing, of becoming. It is the negation of the exteriority of space, but also in a purely exterior way (EN, § 257). So time too is a pure form of sensibility, a ‘non-sensuous sensibility’ (unsinnliche Sinnlichkeit). It is the principle of subjectivity, hence movement, but remaining external, and hence as simple becoming (EN, § 258). It is not a container either. We should not say, everything comes to be and passes away in time, but rather time itself is the becoming, the coming to be and passing away, ‘the Chronos which engenders all and destroys that to which it gives birth’ (EN, § 258, Remark). The natural falls under this becoming because it is not in full agreement with its concept.

So space and time are not containers, but they are not just properties of things; they are conditions of things, since they are the exterior forms without which things would not be. ‘Time is merely this abstraction of destroying... Things themselves are what is temporal. Temporality is their objective determination. It is therefore the process of actual things which constitutes time’ (EN, § 258, Addition, pp. 80–1).9

But the negation of space through time is not going to be satisfactory, we still have nothing but flowing away. As well as their unity in Becoming, time and space have to have a subsisting unity, analogous to Dasein. Hegel derives this through place, movement, and finally matter. The point was a first stab at some subsistent centre, which failed. But now out of the movement of space to time and back again, we have the point attaining greater concreteness as the place. In other words time cannot just be the negation of space, and space of time; but they have to unite. And this unity is place. This is the enduring (Dauer, das Dauernde); that which remains through time. There must be something enduring. All cannot simply flow away; this would not yield any existence. The enduring is place as here and now (EN, § 260).

But place goes through the same dialectic as point. It is negative in itself. It is thus indifferent to itself; there is nothing to distinguish it from all others; or it is only distinguished from outside. As space and time it is boundaryless, continuing into other. It requires a reference system outside itself to be determined. So it is external to itself; and we are once more in change. But now we have place changing, and this is movement. (EN, § 261).

But we cannot just go back; this is not just the abstract negation of space; It is actual change of place, and this requires that there be some unity between the two places. For there to be motion, there must be matter (EN, § 261).

So for there to be real unity of time and space, there must be matter; a reality which is partes extra partes, and yet has some unity. It is identity and yet difference. But since it is not simple self-identity, it must be in motion. Matter and motion are correlatives. Both are to be seen as the unity of space and time. Motion relates space to time. * Its essence is to be the immediate unity of space and time; it is time realizing itself and subsisting in space, or space first truly differentiated through time.’ (EL, § 261, Addition, p. 91.) Time first has reality when there is something changing; and space is first really differentiated when something moves from here to there. In other words, the negation of space through time becomes real only through matter in motion; for matter gives reality, and its motion is the cancellation of its exteriority which time was trying to be.

Hegel then goes on (EN, § 262) to deduce gravity. Matter is both attraction and repulsion, for the same kinds of reasons as we saw in Quantity. As negative unity of these moments it is a particular, a centre but which is still separate from the exteriority of matter. This is gravity. We have the beginning of subjectivity, but it is still always outside itself. The middle point to which it strives is always outside it.

So we go naturally to the total system of these bodies; here we have absolute mechanics – the solar system.

But this brings us to the unity of form and matter. The form has found itself in matter. Or matter in its totality has now found the centre it was looking for. So we get to the next step up on the scale, which is qualified matter; not just homogeneous gravitational matter; but matter with a specific substantial nature (EN, § 271).

In other words, we started with just exteriority. But exteriority cannot stand by itself; and it comes through attraction and repulsion to gravity; and this develops to system; and from this we go beyond to see matter as differentiated. ‘Its abstract, dulled being-in-self, general weightedness, has been resolved into form; it is qualified matter.’ (EN, § 271.)10

II

This second sphere corresponds to Essence. Now the form differences differentiate matter itself. And so they are related to each other; but still externally, or by a merely hidden unity.

This sphere falls into three parts which are not easy to understand in their articulation. Hegel admits that this is the hardest part of the Naturphilosophie (EN, § 273, Addition). The following seems to be the gist.

First we have the simple differentiation of physical qualities. They are taken as simple qualities. Each is internally unarticulated as formerly matter itself was. They have no inner centre, but are still taken as bodies related to a centre by their gravity, which takes the role in this dialectic of relatedness to others.

This first chapter takes these simple physical qualities through three phases. First we see them in different heavenly bodies, the sun as the source of light, the moon, comets, the planets. Secondly, we see these qualities in the elements, where Hegel takes up the four classical ones, air, fire, water, earth, and attributes certain properties to each, and certain conceptual affinities. Thirdly, we see all these in process, in interaction, in the meteorological process.

This gives us a picture of the unity of a system as negative unity, and hence real individuality (EN, § 289). We achieve here a self-like nature (‘Selbstischkeit’); and this is now seen in matter, in objects. This means that they are seen as having an inner unity, and inner process, or life other than their relation to others in gravity. They are not simple physical qualities, but are objects which are the locus of inner activity, or of inner force.

The account of this stage is in four parts. First we see the ‘selfishness’ in the property of specific gravity. In this way the body gives itself its specific ‘Being in Self’ (Insichsein). In other words, we begin to account further by internal parameters for the properties of the body. We then go over into cohesion. But we reach higher inwardness with Sound (Klang). This is a kind of ideal cancellation of the exteriority of the thing in different parts; it is the expression of its inner vibration. It is thus a kind of gathering up into ideality of its material existence, of spatiality into temporality. It is rather like the soul of its body. It rings out when it suffers violence and quivers (erzittert) in itself; or when it triumphantly maintains itself. Fourthly, the kind of unity which the Klang represents ideally comes materially in heat, which melts and dissolves inner difference.

So, thirdly, this takes us to a higher form of inwardness, where objects have not only an inner unity, but are seen to produce themselves out of an inner process. We have not only stepped from the simple quality to an internal articulation which underlies it; but we are now going to see the form as fully embodied in it, the object with its specific quality is produced by the form. Thus although in the second phase the object had its own individuality over against the relation to a centre (gravity); now it steps right out of the relation, in that we see it as an inner process with its own centre (as every process must have). We are needless to say on the threshold of life.

In this chapter, Hegel tries to derive, inter alia, magnetism and electricity, and takes us up through the transition to chemism. Chemism shows us the relativity of immediate substances and properties. And seeing these deployed by a visible, unified life-form is the next stage, life.

III

Life is recounted in three parts. First we have the world as a whole which is in a sense an organism, but not really a living one, ‘only the corpse of the life-process’ (EN, § 337). It does not really return to itself. It is external to itself. It really belongs to the previous forms in its detail; but as a whole it shows an order which is that of the Concept, and therefore deserves consideration here. Hegel considers under this head: the history of the world and its geographical lay-out, geological phenomena, and the operation of atmosphere, sea and land.

But as Life world has to go over into real life. So there has to be the real living individual. Real life is where this inner necessity is manifest in the reality concerned; where the unity of the Concept is essential to the explanation of what goes on. The living organism as matter operates by the laws of the Concept and does not just end up presenting an order which is ultimately related to the Concept but which can also be understood by laws which make no reference to this inner unity itself. The living are such that what they do and are can only be explained as coming about for the sake of their form.

So there must be living organisms. The organic is related in three ways to its inorganic base (EN, § 342). First it is one with the organic, for the living being has its own inorganic in itself, in a sense. It is constantly making itself one life, through a digestion process of itself, as it were (EN, § 342, Addition, pp. 492–3). It articulates itself into members and holds these in the same life process. Secondly, the organic individual must be over against the inorganic, it feeds off it. It knows the inorganic is inessential; but this represents a reversal, because it is also sustained by the whole which is largely inorganic. Then thirdly, we have the reproduction process which we have already seen. The individual becomes two, and goes under in the production of a new individual.

The second chapter treats then of the lowest form of real organic life -plants. These, says Hegel, grow out and unfold themselves, but lack the element of return to themselves. They grow out indefinitely. They grow to manifold, but cannot gather this up into unity. They have no real differentiation of an inner kind, for instance, entrails. Without this differentiation and without the moment of unity which goes with it they cannot move, they have no self-feeling (Selbstgefühl), and they are related only to elements, not to things. Their self is not really objective. They are inner, and so outer. Hegel then takes plants through the three processes defined above: the formation-process, the assimilation-process, and the generic- or reproduction-process.

On the other hand the animal is a self reflected in himself, the unity comes to subjective universality (EN, § 350). The animal organism retains the unity in the articulation of its members. So animals have self-movement (EN, § 351). An animal has a voice which expresses its soul and presents a free ‘quivering in itself’ (Erzittern in sich selbst). It has animal warmth, as the continuous dissolution-process of its own cohesion and new production of its members. It can break off feeding; and above all it has feeling which is its simple individuality. It is also related to objects, not elements. So the beast also has a theoretical relation to things, and also a unity of theoretical and practical in his drive to shape things (Bildungstrieb).

Hegel then goes through the three processes with animals. As usual sensibility, irritability and reproduction have their place. But one important theme is the close relation between the reproduction process and death. What animals seek in the other sex is the Genus (Gattung); they sense their insufficiency, and it is this which brings them down. The Genus is thus the death of individuals, and lower organisms often die directly after the act of reproduction (EN, § 369, Addition). Only Spirit can carry the burden of the Genus without going under.

And hence the Naturphilosophie ends with a passage to Spirit out of the death of the animate. ‘The original disease of the animal, and the inborn germ of death is its being inadequate to universality’ (EN, § 375)11 The individual is trying to embody the universal in itself, but can only do this in an abstract way, as a simple habit, as the sinking to regularity. But life requires that we constantly overcome difference. With the disappearance of diversity into regularity goes the end of the tension which sustains life and hence old age and death. Sickness itself (EN, § 371) is really a part of the system which, triggered by conflict with the outside, becomes fixed in its own activity and works against the whole. So sickness is nothing but the first source of death, for death we have seen is just such a hardening against the tension of life.

Spirit thus comes out of nature. The animal got away from gravity in moving himself, in sensation he felt himself, in voice he hears himself. But still the full process, the Genus only exists in the endless progress of individuals. So ‘the idea has to break out of this sphere, and draw breath by shattering this inadequate existence’ (EN, § 376, Addition).12 The next step is Spirit, as consciousness that can carry the whole idea in unity. The goal of nature is to die, to burn itself as Phoenix, so that Spirit can rise.

Spirit comes out of nature. It is also prior to it, but it lets itself come out of nature. Its infinite freedom leaves nature free to operate by its inner necessity (loc. cit.), as we saw at the end of the logic.

But Geist wants to come to freedom by recognizing himself in nature. And this is the work of the philosophy of nature. Our aim is to force the Proteus of nature to show in exteriority only the mirror of ourselves, to be a free reflection of Geist. This was not easy because the Concept is sunk in a lot of refractory (widerspenstig) detail. But reason has to have faith in itself. We cannot deduce everything; ‘thus we must not seek determinations of the Concept everywhere, although traces of them are everywhere present’ (EN, § 370, Addition, p. 680). But we can hope to find ‘the real shape of the Concept which lies concealed under the mutual externality of infinitely numerous forms’ (EN, § 376, Addition).

With this derivation of Spirit, the philosophy of nature ends. Let us turn now to domains where the work of the spirit is more transparently evident; and first to history, spirit’s unfolding in time.

 

 

1 The only sign of Hegel’s interest in this area in the 1790s is the unpublished MS which has been entided ‘The earliest System Programme of German Idealism’, where Hegel speaks of ‘giving wings back to our physics which advances slowly and laboriously by experiment’ (Hegel’s Werke, Suhrkamp edition, Frankfurt 1971, Vol. 1, p. 234). This text was long attributed to Schelling.

2 Naturally Hegel wants sharply to differentiate his philosophy of nature from that of the Romantics, which he considers largely arbitrary and gratuitous, based as it is on intuition, which is really only a ‘Verfahren der Vorstellung und Phantasie (auch der Phantasterei) nach Analogien...’ (EN, §246, note).
