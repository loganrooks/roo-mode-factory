Introduction to the History
of Philosophy
THE MATTER UNDER CONSIDERATION HERE IS HISTORY. History's
form is the presentation of a succession of events and
deeds. But what are the deeds proper to the history of philosophy?
They are the activities of free thought; this means
the way the intellectual world has come into being, been
produced, developed. What we are to consider, then, is the
history of thought.
There is an age-old assumption that thinking distinguishes
man from the beast. This we shall accept. What
makes man nobler than the beast is what he possesses
through thought. Whatever is human is so only to the
extent that therein thought is active; no matter what its
outward appearance may be, if it is human, thought makes
it so. In this alone is man distinguished from the beast.
Still, insofar as thought is in this way the essential, the
substantial, the active in man, it has to do with an infinite
manifold and variety of objects. Thought will be at its best,
however, when it is occupied only with what is best in man,
with thought itself, where it wants only itself, has to do
with itself alone. For, to be occupied with itself is to dis-
67
68 HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
cover itself by creating itself; 1 and this it can do only by
manifesting itself. Thought is active only in producing itself;
and it produces itself by its very own activity. It is not
simply there; it exists only by being its own producer. What
it thus produces is philosophy, and what we have to investigate
is the series of such productions, the millennia! work
of thought in bringing itself forth, the voyage of discovery
upon which thought embarks in order to discover itself.
This says in general what our subject-matter is. Still, the
statement is so general that there is need to determine more
precisely our purpose and the manner of attaining it.
The general remarks we have just made already provide
the occasion for further reflection, and it is proper to philosophical
consideration to reflect immediately on what has
been thought, not to let it be put to use in the way it has
been unreflectively thought. As we have said, our subjectmatter
is the series of free thought's productions, the history
of the intellectual world. The statement is simple, yet it
seems to involve a contradiction. The thought which is
essentially thought is in and for itself; it is eternal. What
truly is is contained only in thought, and it is true not only
today and tomorrow but eternally, outside all time, and,
to the extent that it is in time, it is forever, at all times,
true. Now, right here the contradiction immediately appears,
i.e., that thought should have a history. What is presented
in history is mutable, has taken place, was once, and
is now past, has sunk into the night of the past, is no longer.
Thought,2 however, is not subject to change, it is not something
that has been or is past, it is. The question, then, is:

we have before us here is the history of thought's
finding itself" (Glockner edition, XIII, 15). [Translator:

thought-and here we are concerned only with
that'' (Glockner, XIII, 16).
Hegel: Introduction 6g
how can what is outside history, since it is not subject to
change, still have a history?
The second reflection concerns the relation of philosophy
to the other forms and products of the spirit. We have already
said that man thinks and that precisely this is essential
to him. We have also said, however, that thought has
purposes other than those of philosophy, that it has to do
with a large number of other objects which are also products
ot activities of thought. Religion, art, statecraft, and
the like, are also works of the thinking spirit, and yet they
must be kept separate from our theme. The question, then,
is: how are these distinguished from the activities of spirit
which constitute our subject-matter? Similarly: what historical
relation is there between the philosophy of a given time
and its religion, art, politics, etc.?
In this Introduction we shall bring out these two points
of view in order to orient ourselves regarding the manner
in which the history of philosophy is to be handled in these
lectures. These two points of view provide a path to a
third, to a division which permits a general overview of the
total historical process. I shall not, however, concern myself
with external reflections on the history of philosophy,
such as its usefulness and other things which can be said
regarding it. Its usefulness will be revealed in the revelation
of philosophy itself.
At the end, however, since this is customary, I shall touch
briefly on the sources for the history of philosophy. An Introduction
should have only one purpose-to give a more
precise picture of what our purpose is. The notiona which
is to be developed here is the concept itself. This concept
a The German word which is here translated as both "picture"
and "notion" is Vorstellung. Literally the term means "representation."
It has, however, so many shades of meaning that we are
forced by the context to translate it in a variety of ways. In general,
then, where the translation is not "representation," the term
Vorstellung will be indicated in parentheses. The term Begriff,
which in so many British translations is rendered as "notion,"
will here be consistently translated as "concept."
HEGEL's InEA oF PHILOSOPHY
does not admit of being proved here (since it is in and for
itself); proof of it belongs to the science of philosophy, in
the order of logic. The concept does, however, admit of
being made acceptable and plausible by being related to
other familiar notions (Vorstellungen) in ordinary cultivated
consciousness. Still, this is not philosophical; it merely
contributes to clarity.
First, then, we shall consider the concept, the purpose of
the history of philosophy. Secondly, we shall consider the
relationship of philosophy to other products of the human
spirit, such as art, religion, statecraft, etc., and especially its
relation to history itself.
A. CONCEPT OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY
What we shall here consider is a succession of the manifestationsb
of thought. This is the first and, therefore, the most
superficial way in which the history of philosophy appears.
Following immediately on this comes the need to become
acquainted with its purpose, with the universal through
which the diversified plurality manifested in the succession
is bound together in such a way that the multiplicity is so
related to its own unity as to be formed into a whole, a
totality. It is this unity which first of all constitutes the purpose
or concept. We are quite correct, then, in wanting to
know a purpose or concept in a determinate way before
going into detail. We want first of all an overall view of
the woods and only after that to know the individual trees.
One who looks first at the trees and sticks only to them does
not get an overall view of the woods and becomes lost and
confused. The same is true of philosophies; they are infinite
in number and are conflictingly opposed to each other. One
b Here, as in the instance above, the German term, Gestaltung(
en), is not easily translated by one English term. It signifies
the form in which something appears, but again the translation
must vary with the context. For the most part it will be rendered
as "manifestation," which em_phasizes the participial connotation
of Gestaltung, as opposed to Gestalt.
Hegel: Introduction
would be confused, then, if one wanted to know first individual
philosophies. It would mean failing to see the
woods for the trees, failing to see philosophy for philosophies.
Nowhere does this happen more readily and more
frequently than in the history of philosophy. The multiplicity
of philosophies frequently occasions a failure to
know and esteem philosophy itself.
On an acquaintance such as this is built the sort of shallow
know-it-all claim to show that nothing comes of the
history of philosophy. One philosophy contradicts another;
the very multiplicity of philosophies proves the inanity of
the philosophical endeavor. This is said, presumably in the
interests of truth or of what one thinks is the truth: the one
thing to be sought is unity, i.e., truth, since truth is one,
and the multitude of philosophies, each one claiming to be
the true one, contradicts the principle which says that the
true is in unity.
Thus, the chief consideration in this Introduction centers
on the question: what is the situation here in regard to the
contradictionbetween the unity of truth and the multiplicity
of philosophies? What is the result of this long labor of
the human spirit, and how is it to be comprehended? What
sense do we want to give to our treatment of the history of
philosophy?
The history of philosophy is the history of free, concrete
thought-which is to say, of reason. Free concrete thought
is concerned only with itself. Nothing can be called reason
which is not the result of thinking-not, however, of abstract
thinking, for that is the thinking proper to understanding,
but of concrete thinking, which is reason. The
question, then, should be expressed more precisely in this
way: in what sense should the history of thinking reason be
considered, i.e., what meaning is to be given to it? To this
we can answer that no other meaning can be given to it
than what is found in the sense of thought itself-or we can
say that the question itself does not make sense. We can ask
'72 HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
with regard to anything whatever what its sense or meaning
is. Thus, with regard to a work of art we can ask what
the picture means, with regard to language what a word
means, with regard to religion what a symbol or a ceremony
means, with regard to other kinds of activity we can ask
about their moral value, etc. The meaning or sense of which
we speak is none other than the essential or the universal,
the substantial in an object, which is the object concretely
thought. Herein we always have a double aspect, an exterior
and an interior, an external appearance which is intuitively
perceptible and a meaning which, precisely, is thought.
Now, because the object with which we are concerned is
thought, there is here no double aspect; it is thought itself
which does the meaning. Here the object is the universal;
so we cannot ask about a meaning which is separate or
separable from the object. The only meaning or determin<ttion
which the history of philosophy has, then, is thought
itself. Herein thought is the innermost, the highest, and one
cannot, therefore, settle on a thought about it. With regard
to a work of art we can reflect on it, advance considerations
whether the form corresponds to its meaning; which means
we can have a position regarding it. The history of free
thought can have no other sense or meaning than that of
speaking about the thought itself. The characterc which
here takes the place of sense and meaning is simply the
thought.
It is our task now to provide the more precise viewpoints
which come into consideration when there is question of
thought.
Here we must propose a series of thought-determinations,
i.e., we must preface the whole thing with some thoroughly
general, abstract concepts, which we shall come back to
• Bestimmung. Here, once more, we are faced with a term whose
literal translation-i.e., "determinatiori."-does not always carry
its meaning in context over into English. Where any ambiguity
might result the German will be given in parentheses.
Hegel: Introduction 73
later, and by applying them get a more precise notion of
the concept of history of philosophy. At this point, however,
the abstract concepts in question are merely presuppositions;
they are not to be treated logically, philosophically,
or speculatively, nor are they to be proved. Here it
should be sufficient to present these concepts historically
and in a provisional way.
1. Preliminary Notions
The notions (Bestimmungen) in question are: thought, concept,
idea or reason, and their development.
1. Thought as Concept and Idea
a. Thought. First, then, there is thought.
(1) As Concept. Thought is not something empty and abstract;
it is determining, in fact self-determining. In other
words, thought is essentially concrete. This concrete
thought we call concept. Thought must be a concept; no
matter how abstract it may seem to be, of itself (in sich)
it must be concrete. As soon as thought is philosophical it
is of itself concrete. From one point of view it is correct to
say that philosophy deals in abstractions, insofar as it has
to do with thoughts, which are abstracted from the sensible,
the so-called concrete. From another point of view it is
quite incorrect to speak in this way: abstractions belong to
the reflection proper to understanding, not to philosophy;
and it is precisely those who condemn philosophy for being
abstract who are most immersed in the sort of reflections
which are proper to understanding, even though they think
they have to do with the concretest of contents. Because they
reflect on the matter at hand (die Sache), what they have
is a combination of the merely sensible and subjective
thoughts-i.e., abstractions.
74 HEGEL'S IDl:A OF PHILOSOPHY
(2) As Idea. In more precise terms, concrete thought is
concept. Still further determined it is idea. The idea is the
concept insofar as it is realized. To be realized it must
determine itself, and this determination is nothing else but
itself. Thus, its content is itself. Its infinite relation to itself,
then, means that only from itself does its determination
come.
Now, the idea is what we call truth-a large word. To the
unprejudiced it will ever continue to be a large word, and it
will make his heart swell. Recently, of course, the conclusion
has been reached that we are incapable of knowing the
truth. The object of philosophy, however, is concrete
thought, and when this is further determined it is, precisely,
idea or truth. As for the claim that the truth cannot be
known, this claim is made specificially (fiir sich)d in the
history of philosophy, and when we come to it we shall
examine it more closely. Here need only be mentioned that
it is to some extent the historians of philosophy themselves
who give the prejudice a semblance of validity. Tennemann,
for example, who is a Kantian, is of the opinion that it is
absurd to want to know the truth; and the proof of this is
the history of philosophy. What is difficult to understand
is that anyone with this conviction should work so hard at
philosophy, could in fact continue to be concerned with it,
with no purpose in mind. This sort of thing makes the
d Since Hegel is not employing this expression here in its technical
dialectical sense, a meaning which suits the context has been
chosen. "Specifically," too, of course, is not being used in its technical
sense. What Hegel is seeking to show here is that the contradictory
claims of this or that philosophy (even if all truthclaims
of all philosophies are contradicted by claims in some
others) neither cancel nor relativize the truth which philosophy as
such pursues. It is because particular claims are particular that
they are partially untrue. But philosophy itself is oriented to universal
truth, and it is only by sharing in this overall orientation
that particular truths are truths at all. If they do share this orientation
they are not the less philosophical (or scientific) for not
being wholly true.
Hegel: Introduction 75
history of philosophy a mere account of all kinds of opinions,
each of which falsely claims to be the truth. Another
prejudice says that we can, of course, know about the truth,
but only after we have reflected on it (that truth is not
known in immediate perception or intuition-neither in
external sensible nor in so-called intellectual intuitionsince
every intuition is as such sensible).s I should like to
call attention to (appellieren an) this prejudice. Granted
that it is one thing to be capable of knowing about the
truth and another to know the truth. It is only by reflection,
however, that I experience what the truth of the matter is.
First, then, there is the contention that we cannot know
the truth and, secondly, that we know truth only through
reflection. If we give a more precise account of these contentions
we shall have progressed further in the picture
(Vorstellung) we are trying to give.
The first determinations we have arrived at, then, are that
thought is concrete, that the concrete is truth, and that the
truth can be the result only of thinking. To be even more
determinate we can say that the spirit develops itself out of
itself.
2. Idea as Development
The first point was that thought, free thought, is in itself
essentially concrete. This implies that it is alive, that it
moves of itself. The infinite nature of spirit is its own
process in itself, which means that it does not rest, that it
is essentially productive and exists by producing. More
precisely we can understand this movement as development;
the concrete as active is essentially self-developing.
This involves making distinctions; and if we understand
3 Alternate reading in the Michelet edition: "Here
provisionally I call attention to the old prejudice
that there is truth, but that one knows about the
true only to the extent that one reflects, not in the
way that one simply walks or stands still ... but
only by the effort of thinking" (Glockner, XIII, 27).
HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
more precisely the character of the distinctions involvedin
the process something different necessarily emerges-the
movement turns out to be development. These distinctions
come out, even when we stop simply at the familiar notion
of development; it is merely a question of reflecting on the
notion of development.
a. Being-in-Itself. With regard to development, what immediately
comes to our attention is that there must be
something there that develops, which is to say something
hidden-the seed, the tendency, the capacity, what Aristotle
calls Svvcxp,t<;, i.e., possibility (not some superficial possibility
as such, but real possibility), or, as it is called, the
in-itself, that which is in itself and at first merely that.
Customarily we have in regard to what is in itself the high
opinion that it is what truly is. To get to know God and the
world is to get to know them in themselves. What is in itself,
however, is not yet the true but only the abstract; it is the
seed of what truly is, the tendency, the being-in-itself of the
true. It is something simple, something which, of course,
contains in itself multiple qualities, but in the form of
simplicity-a content which is still hidden.
An example of this is the seed. The seed is simple, almost
a point; even through a microscope it can scarcely be seen.
This simple thing, however, is pregnant with all the qualities
of the tree. In the seed is contained the whole tree, its
trunk, branches, leaves, its color, odor, taste, etc. Nevertheless,
this simple thing is the seed, not the tree itself; the fully
articulated tree does not yet exist. It is essential to know
that there is something utterly simple, which in itself contains
a manifold, which latter, however, does not yet exist
for itself. A more important example is the I. When I say
I, this is the utterly simple, the abstract universal, that which
is common to all, for everyone is an I. Still, the I which
each one is is the most diverse wealth of notions, drives,
desires, inclinations, thoughts, etc. In this simple point, the
Hegel: Introduction 77
I, all this is contained. It is the force, the concept of all
that man develops out of himself. With Aristotle we can
say that in the simple, which is in itself, in the 8vvafLt~,
potentia, in the tendency, all that develops is contained.
In development no more comes out than what is already
there in itself.
b. Being-there.e What follows is. that the in-itself, the
simple, the hidden, develops and unfolds. For it to develop
means to posit itself, to enter into existence, to be as something
distinct. At first it is distinct only in itself, and it
exists only in this simplicity or neutrality, like water which
is so clear and transparent and yet contains within itself
so many physical and chemical materials, even organic
possibilities. Whether it is in itself and hidden, or whether
it is revealed and, as such, exists, it is one and the same
thing, or rather, one and the same content. The difference
is simply one of form, but on this difference everything
depends.
The big difference consists in this: Man knows what he
is, and only when he does so is he actually what he is. Without
this, knowing reason is nothing, nor is freedom. Man
is essentially reason; man and child, educated and uneducated,
each is reason; or rather, the possibility of being
reason is present in each, is given. Still, reason is of no
use to the child, to the uneducated. It is only a possibility;
and yet, not an empty but a real possibility, with its own
orientation to fulfillment.t Only the adult, the educated,
knows through experience that he is what he is. The difference
is simply that in the one case reason is present only
as a tendency, only in itself, whereas in the other case it is so
• Dasein. Although the term is familiar enough, various philosophers
give to it different shades of meaning. For Hegel, it signifies
"empirical being"-i.e. being as manifested in experience.
• Sick treibende. It needs no impulse from without to actualize
it.
HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
explicitly, beyond the form of possibility and posited in
existence.
The whole difference in world-history is reducible to this
difference. All men are rational, and the formal element in
this rationality is human freedom; this is man's nature, it
belongs to his essence. Still, among many peoples slavery has
existed, to some extent it still does, and people are satisfied
with it. Orientals, for example, are men and as such free,
and yet they are not free, because they have no consciousness
of their freedom but are willing to accept every sort of
religious and political despotism. The whole difference between
Oriental peoples and those who are not subject to
slavery is that the latter know that they are free, that to
be free is proper to them.
The former are also in themselves free, but they do not
exist as free. This, then, introduces an enormous difference
into man's world-historical situation, whether he is free
merely in himself or whether he knows that it is his concept,
his vocation, his nature, to be as a free individual.
This, then, is the second point-simply this difference of
existential separateness. In itself the I is free, but it is also
free for itself; and I am, only to the extent that I exist as
free.
c. Being-for-itself. The third determination is that what is
in itself and what exists and is for itself are one and the
same. This is precisely what is meant by development. If
the in-itself were no longer the in-itself, then something
else would be there, and a complete change would have
taken place. In this case there is something and it becomes
something else. In regard to development, it is true, we can
also speak of change, but the change must be such that the
other which results is nevertheless still identical with the
first, such that the simple, the in-itself, is not annihilated. It
is something concrete, something differentiated, but still
maintained in the unity of the original in-itself.
Hegel: Introduction 79
This is what the seed does; it does not change completely
but develops. If it changes completely, by being crushed or
pulverized, then it cannot develop. This unity of what is
present, the existing, and what is in itself is the essential in
development. The unity of the differentiated, of the seed
and that into which it has developed, is a speculative concept,
where they are two and still one. It is a concept of
reason; all other determinations in this regard belong simply
to understanding. But abstract understanding cannot comprehend
this unity; it sticks with the difference and can
grasp only abstractions, not the concrete, the concept.
At the same time, development involves mediation; the
one is only to the extent to which it is related to the other.
What is in itself has the drive to develop, to exist, to pass
over into the form of existence; and existence requires the
mediation of this sort of tendency. Actually, nothing is
immediate. In recent times much noise has been made
about immediate knowledge, intuition, etc., but this is
only a bad, one-sided abstraction. Philosophy has to do with
the real, with concepts. The immediate is simply the unreal.
In all that is called immediate knowledge, etc., it is easy to
show that mediation is present. As soon as anything is true,
it contains in itself mediation; just as mediation, if it is
not merely abstract, contains immediacy.
If, in regard to realization, what came first was the initself,
the seed, etc., and second, existence, i.e., what emerges,
then third comes the identity of both, more precisely the
fruit of development, the result of the entire movement;
and this is what I call, abstractly, being-for-itself. It is the
being-for-itself of man, of spirit itself, since a plant does not
have being-for-itself, if we speak in a language which has
reference to consciousness. Only spirit becomes truly for
itself, identical with itself.
There we have the concept of development, a thoroughly
general concept. It is vitality, movement as such. The life
of God in Himself, the life of universality in nature and
So HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
spirit, the life of whatever lives, the lowest as well as the
highest, that is what development is. It i~ a self-differentiation,
a bringing of itself into real being (Dasein), into
being-for-another while still remaining identical with itself.
It is the eternal creation of the world, which in another
form is the generation of the Son, and it is the eternal
return of the Spirit into itself-an absolute movement which
is at the same time rest, absolute re~t-eternal self-mediation.
This is the being-with-itself of the idea, the capacity
to return into itself, to join with the other and in the other
to have itself. This capacity, this power, to be with itself
in what is the negative of itself, is also the freedom of man.
3· Development as Concretion
What concerns us here more precisely is the formal. If
absolute development, the life of God and of the Spirit, is
only one process, only one movement, then it is merely
abstract. But universal movement as concrete is a series of
manifestations (Gestaltungen) of the Spirit. This series
should not be pictured as a straight line but as a circle, a
return into itself. This circle has as its circumference a
large number of circles; one development is always a movement
passing through many developments; the totality of
this series is a succession of developments curving back on
itself; and each particular development is a stage of the
whole. Although there is progress in. development, it does
not go forward into (abstract) infinity but rather turns back
into itself.
Spirit must know itself, externalize itself, have itself as
object, must know itself in such a way as to exhaust its own
possibilities in becoming totally object to itself. It must
reveal itself completely, going down into its uttermost
depths and revealing those depths. The higher spirit's
development is, the deeper it is; in this way it is really
deep, not just in itself; in itself it is neither deep nor high.
Development is precisely a self-deepening of spirit, such that
Hegel: Introduction 81
it brings its own depths to consciousness. The goal of spirit
is, if we may employ the expression, to comprehend itself,
to remain no longer hidden to itself. The road to this is its
development, and the series of developments form the levels
of its development.
Now, to the extent that something is the result of a level
in a development it is once again the starting-point of a
new and further development. The end of one level is always
the beginning of another. Goethe, therefore, is correct
when he says somewhere,4 "What has been formed
becomes ever again matter."
The levels are distinct; each subsequent level is more concrete
than the preceding; and the lowest is the most abstract.
Thus, in regard to spirit, children are the most abstract; they
are rich in sensible intuitions but poor in thoughts. At the
beginning of a lecture we usually have much sensible
material, which is poorest in regard to thoughts. Our first
thoughts are more abstract determinations of our thinking
than are later ones. Thus, we first come up against the notion
of thing. There is no thing;g it is only a thought; and
so in the beginning only such abstract determinations of
our thinking emerge. The abstract is simple and easy. Subsequent
stages are more concrete. They presuppose the determinations
proper to previous stages, and they develop
them further. Each subsequent stage of the development,
then, is richer, augmented by these determinations and,
thereby, more concrete. There is, then, no thought which
does not progress in its development.
These are the notions (Bestimrnungen) I wanted to present
by way of preface to my remarks. I have not proved
them, only given an ordered enumeration of them, seeking
4 [Editor's note in Hoffmeister edition: ] "The reference
is probably to Schiller's Votivtafel 39, 'The
Imitator.'"
• The mere designation "thing" ignores or suppresses the determinations
belonging to the real.
HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
to make them plausible to those who follow our way of
thinking.
Now we have to make an application of these notions
and see their concrete consequences. For that reason I have
proposed them. We now turn to what is more precise, more
determinate, in the matter of history, i.e., of the history of
philosophy.
u. Application of these Notions (Bestimmungen) to
the History of Philosophy
1. a. In accord with these notions philosophy is thought
brought to consciousness, occupied with itself, made into its
own object, thinking itself, and that in terms of the various
notions proper to it. Thus, the science of philosophy is a
development of free thought, or rather it is the whole of
this development; it is a circle which returns into itself,
remains entirely with itself, is entirely itself, and wants to
return only to itself. When we are occupied with the sensible
we are not with ourselves but with something other.
It is different when we are occupied with thought; thought
is with itself only. Philosophy, then, is the development of
thought, undisturbed in its activity. Thus, philosophy is a
system. In recent times, system has become a term of reproach,
because from it one gets the impression that it
clings to a one-sided principle. The proper meaning of
system, however, is totality, and it is true only as such a
totality, whose point of departure is the most simple but
which makes itself ever more concrete through development.
b. Now, the history of philosophy is precisely that and
nothing else. In philosophy as such, in the present, most
recent philosophy, is contained all that the work of millennia
has produced; it is the result of all that has preceded it.
And the same development of Spirit, looked at historically,
is the history of philosophy. It is the history of all the deHegel:
Introduction Sg
velopments which Spirit has undergone, a presentation of
its moments or stages as they follow one another in time.
Philosophy presents the development of thought as it is
in and for itself, without addition; the history of philosophy
is this development in time. Consequently the history
of philosophy is identical with the system of philosophy.
Admittedly, this identity is at this point simply asserted;
the proper speculative proof cannot here be given. The
proof involves the nature of reason, of thinking, and this
is to be taken up in the science of philosophy itself. The
history of philosophy provides the empirical proof. Such
a history's task is to show that its own process is the systematizing
of thought itself. In it will be presented what
is presented in philosophy, simply with the addition of
time, of the incidental historical circumstances connected
with countries, various individuals, etc. When in time philosophy
appears is a matter we shall consider in the second
part of the Introduction.
Spirit in and for itself is quite completely, through and
through, concrete. Since it is active, not only does its form
consist in its becoming conscious of itself in pure thought,
but it emerges in the totality of what belongs to its manifestation
(Gestaltung), a world-historical manifestation. When
Spirit progresses it must progress in its totality, and, since
its progress takes place in time, its total development, too,
takes place in time. The thought which is fundamental to a
given time is the all-pervading spirit. This latter must
progress in consciousness of itself, and such a progress is
the development of the whole mass (Masse), of the concrete
totality, which is externalized and, therefore, takes place in
time.
Since the history of philosophy has to do with pure
thought it is itself a science, i.e., not an accumulation of
knowledge ordered in a certain manner but a thoughtdevelopment
which in and for itself is necessary. It must,
however, take into account the necessity that the emergence
HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
of thought take place in time. This, after all, is a course in
history, and we must proceed historically, i.e., we must take
up these manifestations (Gestaltungen) in their temporal
succession, whereby they give the impression, in the manner
in which they appear, of being contingent and unconnected.
In so doing, however, we must emphasize the necessity inherent
in the process of philosophy.
This is the sense, the meaning, of the history of philosophy.
Philosophy develops through its history, and vice
versa. Philosophy and history of philosophy mirror each
other. To study the history of philosophy is to study
philosophy itself, and this principally as a logic.h We shall
speak further. on of the concrete. In order to interpret the
history of philosophy in this way, one must, it is true, previously
know what philosophy is and what its history is.
Still, one must not take an a priori view of the history of
philosophy based on the principles of one philosophy.
Purely historically, thought shows the way it progresses for
itself.
c. More precisely, then, how does the development of
philosophy make its appearance in time? We said, with
regard to thought, that there is no asking what its meaning
is, since it is its own meaning; there is nothing hidden
behind it~not, however, in the ordinary sense of that expression,
for thought itself is the ultimate, the deepest, behind
which there is nothing further; it is entirely itself.
Still, thought also has an appearance, and to the extent that
one distinguishes the appearance from the thought, it is
possible to speak of thought's meaning. One of the ways
thought appears, after all, is in one's own idea of it; another
is the historical.
The first appearance of thought is such that thinking, or
thought, appears as something particular. In addition to the
11 Whose development is rational and, therefore, necessary.
Hegel: Introduction
fact that we think, that there are thoughts, there are senseperceptions,
drives, inclinations, determinations of the
will, etc. We have, thus, other faculties or activities of the
soul which possess a right equal to that of thinking. In this
way, then, thought is there as a particular among particulars.
In philosophy, however, an entirely different notion (Vorstellung)
of thinking and of thought must be formed.
Thinking is the activity of the universal. Insofar as in addition
there are other activities, of course, this activity is
particular. It is its true nature, however, to subsume under
itself all the others. Thus, it is through thinking that man
is distinguished from the beast. Feelings, drives, etc., are
common to man and beast. Still, special types of feeling,
such as religious, legal,i or moral feelings, are proper to man
alone. In themselves feelings are as such in no way either
worthwhile or true. What is true in them-e.g., that a feeling
is religious-derives only from thinking. The beast
has no religion, but it does have feelings. Moreover, man has
religion only because he is a thinking being. Thinking is
the simply universal, and concrete thinking has in itself
its own particularization, which is to say that in thought
the particular is not equivalent to the abstract.
Connected with this last, another way that thinking appears
is as subjective. Thought is proper to man alone-not,
however, to man only as an isolated individual subject; we
have to look at thought as essentially objective. Thought
is simply the universal; even in nature, with its class-conceptsi
and its laws, we recognize the presence of thoughts.
They are, then, not only in the form that consciousness gives
them but in and for themselves and, by that very fact,
objectively. The world's reason is not subjective reason.
Thought is the substantial, the true, as compared with the

of moral entity whereby men are related to each other in society.
1 Gattungen. There are classes in nature, only to the extent that
man (spirit, thought) thinks nature.
86 HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
singular, which is momentary, passing, temporary. To
know the nature of thought is to eliminate the subjective
manner in which it appears. This means, then, that it is
'not merely something particular, subjective, belonging only
to our own consciousness, .but rather the universal, the
objective in and for itself.
A second appearance of thought is, as we have already
mentioned, the historical, according to which the determinations
of thought have emerged at a particular time, in a particular
place, to a particular individual, with the result that
the sequence in which thought is manifested seems accidental.
We have already spoken of how such an impression
is supported. We take up thoughts historically, in the way
they have made their appearance in this or that individual,
etc. Here there is a temporal development, but one which
follows the inner necessity of the concept.
The only worthwhile way of looking at the history of
philosophy, what makes it truly interesting, is seeing that
it shows there is rationality in the world, even from this
point of view. There is a strong antecedent presumption that
this is so; the history of philosophy is the development of
thinking reason; hence its growth can be presumed to have
been rational. The temple of reason in its consciousness of
itself is loftier than Solomon's temple and others built by
man. The building of it has been rational-not like the
way the Jews or the Freemasons go about building Solomon's
temple.
One can bring with him to the enterprise the belief that
the building process has been rational. This is a belief in
providence-in a somewhat different way. What is best in
the world is what thought has produced. It makes no sense,
then, to see reason only in nature and not in spirit, in history,
etc. If on the one hand we are of the opinion that providence
governs the world and, on the other, hold that world"
events in the realm of spirit-which is what philosophies
are-are accidental, the second view (Vorstellung) contraHegel:
Introduction
diets the first. To put it more forcibly: the belief in providence
is not serious; it is mere empty chatter. What has
happened, however, has happened, because providence with
its thoughts has been in charge.
2. a. The first conclusion we can draw from the foregoing
is that in the history of philosophy we are not dealing with
opinions. In everyday life, of course, we have to do with
opinions, i.e., thoughts about external things; one has one
opinion, another has another. But in the business of the
world's Spirit there is a completely different seriousness; it
is there that universality is. There it is a question of the
universal determination of the Spirit, nor do we speak of
this or that one's opinion. The universal Spirit develops
in itself according to its own necessity; its opinion is
simply the truth.
b. The second conclusion is the answer to the question::
What is the situation in regard to diverse philosophies,
about which we hear it said that they are a proof against
philosophy itself, i.e., against truth? First of all we must say,
there is only one philosophy. Now this, of course, has a
formal sense, since each philosophy is at least philosophy
(to the extent that it really is philosophy-frequently what
is called philosophy is simply chatter, arbitrary caprice,
etc). Just as different kinds of fruit are all fruit, so are we to
look upon the relation of various philosophies to the one
philosophy.5 A more precise sense in which we can speak of
many philosophies is to say that th~y are the necessary stages
in the development of reason coming to consciousness of
itself, a reason which is one in the way we previously understood
it. The manner in which they succeed each other,
• [Editor's note in Hoffmeister edition:] "Cf. Schiller,
Votivtafel 53: 'Which of all the philosophies remains,
I know not. But Philosophy, I hope, will
endure forever.'"
88 HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
then, is necessary. No philosophy, therefore, can make its
appearance sooner than it does. It is true, of course, that in
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries ancient philosophies
were resurrected-this was necessary to the progress of
Christian culture. Nevertheless, when past philosophies
return again they are like mummies of earlier thoughts. The
World-Spirit has progressed, and a past philosophy is not its
proper garment, the form in which it finds expressed what it
in fact is.
With regard to the refutation of one philosophy by another,
a more precise characterization (Bestimmung) is required,
one which will be made manifest in the history of
philosophy itself, one which shows in what relation philosophies
stand to each other and to what extent the position
(Stellung) of their principle has changed. Refutation, as we
have seen, involves a negation, namely that what had been
believed regarding a system of philosophy no longer holds.
Now, such a negation is of two types. In one form, when
some philosophy or another is compared with an earlier
one and the principle of the later one is affirmed, then the
subsequent system shows the untenability of the earlier. In
itself every principle of the understanding is one-sided, and
such a one-sidedness is brought out by the fact that another
principle is contrasted with it. This other principle,
however, is equally one-sided. In this situation there is
present no totality as the unity in which they are reconciled;
it exists only as completeness in the process of development.
In this way, for example, Epicureanism stands in opposition
to Stoicism, or the Spinozistic substance of absolute
unity is opposed to that of the Leibnizian monad, in its
concrete individuality. Thus, the self-developing Spirit
integrates the one-sidedness of the one principle by making
the other appear. The second, more profound form of
negation consists in the unification of diverse philosophies
into one whole in such a way that no one of them remains
independent, but all appear as parts of the one. Their
Hegel: Introduction Sg
principles are united by being reduced to elements of the
one idea; or they consist merely in moments, determinations,
aspects of the one idea. This, then, is the concrete
which unites the others in itself and constitutes the true
unity of these diverse forms.
The concrete of which we speak is to be distinguished
from the eclectic procedure, i.e., from a mere combining of
diverse principles and opinions, like combining different
pieces of cloth in one garment. The concrete is the absolute
and complete identity of those differences, not an external
combining of them-just as the human soul is the concrete
in relation to souls in general, since the vegetable soul is
contained in the animal and the latter in the human. Convergences
(Knoten) such as these, where certain particularities,
certain philosophies, are united in one, we shall become
acquainted with in the history of philosophy. One
such, for example, is the Platonic philosophy. If we pick
up Plato's dialogues we find that some are Eleatic, others
Pythagorean, and still others Heraclitean in character; yet
Plato's philosophy has united in itself these earlier philosophies
and in so doing has transformed their inadequacies.
This is no eclectic philosophy but rather an absolute, true
penetration into the unification of these philosophies. Another
example is Alexandrian philosophy, which has also
been called Neoplatonic, Neopythagorean, and Neoaristotelian-
it unified in itself precisely these opposites.
c. A third conclusion to be drawn from what has been said
up to this point is that we are not dealing with what is past
but rather with actual thinking, with our own spirit. Properly
speaking, then, this is not a history, since the thoughts,
the principles, the ideas with which we are concerned belong
to the present; they are determinations within our own
spirit. The historical, i.e., the past as such, is no longer, it is
dead. The tendency to be abstractly historical, to be occupied
with lifeless objects, has in recent times gained ground.
go HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
But the heart must be dead which finds satisfaction with
dead bodies. The spirit of truth and life lives only in what
is. The living spirit speaks: "Let the dead bury their dead;
follow me!" If I know thoughts, truths, cognitions, only
historically, they remain outside my spirit, i.e., for me they
are dead; neither my thinking nor my spirit is present in:
them; what is most interior to me, my thought, is absent ..
The possession of merely historical knowledge is like the
legal ownership of things which I do not know what to do
with. If we simply stop at the knowledge of what this or
that philosophy has thought, of what has been handed down
(uberliefert), then we surrender (iiberliefert) ourselves, and
we forgo what makes man to be man, we forgo thinking.
We are, thus, occupied merely with the thinking and the
spirit of others, we investigate only what has been truth for
others. Now, we must think for ourselves. If our interest
in theology is merely historical-if, for example, we learn
only what Church councils, or heretics and non-heretics,
have known about God's nature-we can, of course, have
had edifying thoughts, but we do not have the spirit properly
speaking. To have this there is no need of theological
erudition. When the historical tendency has taken over a
given age, it can be taken for granted that the spirit has
fallen into despair, has died, has given up the attempt to
satisfy itself-otherwise it would not be concerned with the
sort of objects which for it are dead.
In the authentic history (Geschichte) of thought it is
thought with which we are concerned; there we have to
consider how the spirit enters into its own depths in order
to arrive at consciousness of itself, as man renders to himself
an account of his spirit's consciousness. In order to do
this, man must be present to his own spirit. Here, however,
I speak only against the merely historical (geschichtliche)
attitude. In no way should this make the study of history
as such something to be despised. We ourselves, in fact,
Hegel: Introduction 91
want to take up the history of philosophy. Still, when an
age treats everything historically (historischk), thus being
constantly occupied solely with the world which no longer
is and so wanders around in mausoleums, then has the
spirit given up its own life which consists in its thinking itself.
Connected with the purely historical (historischen) manner
of treating philosophy is the demand that one who
teaches the history of philosophy be uninvolved (unparteiisch).
This insistence on non-involvement means for the
most part simply that the one who teaches history of philosophy
shall act like a dead man in presenting philosophies,
that he should treat them as something separated from his
own spirit, something external, that he should himself be
without thought in treating them. Tennemann, for example,
conveys this impression of non-involvement. If we
look at him more closely, however, we find him completely
caught up in the Kantian philosophy, whose main contention
is that the true is not to be known. In that case, however,
the history of philosophy is a sorry affair, where one
knows ahead of time that one must put up with unsuccessful
efforts. Tennemann praises the most diverse philosophers
for their erudition, their genius, etc., but he finds fault with
them for not having adopted the Kantian point of view or,
simply, for having philosophized. One should not, if one
follows this view, be on the side of thinking spirit. Still, if
one wants to study the history of philosophy properly, then
non-involvement consists in not opting for the opinions,
thoughts, concepts of individuals. But, one must be involved
in philosophy and not be satisfied with limiting oneself
merely to the knowledge of what others have thought.
"Ordinarily Hegel distinguishes sharply between the inner
movement which is history (Geschichte) and the external account
(Historie) of this movement. Here the terminology becomes somewhat
confusing.
92 HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
Truth will be known (erkannt) only when with his spirit
one is in it; mere knowledge about (Kenntnis) it does not
show that one is in it.
To all this I should like to add a few remarks regarding
the manner of treating the history of philosophy.
m. Consequences in Regard to Treating the
History of Philosophy
It is obvious before we start that one semester is too short a
time in which to come quite thoroughly to terms with the
history of philosophy, a work of the Spirit which spans
millennia. The field, therefore, has to be narrowed. From
what we have already said concerning the kind of history
we want to speak about, there are, in regard to its extension,
two conclusions to be drawn.
1. We limit ourselves to principles and to their development
in the various philosophies. This will be particularly
true when we are treating of the earlier philosophies, not so
much because of the lack of time, but rather because in
them only principles can be of interest to us. They are the
most abstract, simplest, and consequently also the most indeterminate
pnnciples-i.e., wherein determinateness has
not yet been posited, even though in them all determinations
are contained. To a certain extent these abstract principles
are adequate; they go far enough to be of interest to
us. Because, however, their development is not yet complete,
qualitatively they are particular, i.e., in their application
they extend only to a delimited sphere. Such, for example,
is the principle of mechanism. Were we to consider what
Descartes has to say about animal nature on the basis of
this principle we should not be satisfied. Our own more
profound concept demands for this a more concrete principle;
it would not be enough for us to use this principle
in explaining plant or animal nature. There is a sphere of
Hegel: Introduction 93
reality suited to an abstract principle; thus the principle of
mechanism is valid for inorganic nature, which belongs to
the sphere of abstract existence. (The living is the concrete,
the inorganic the abstract.) For a higher sphere, however,
the principle of mechanism is inadequate. To give another
example, the ancient abstract philosophies looked at the
universe from the standpoint of the atomistic principl€.
Such a principle is totally inadequate, when there is question
of life, of spirit. A consideration, therefore, of its relationship
to life or to spirit is of no interest to us. From this
point of view, then, it is philosophical interest which determines
us to consider here only the principles of these
philosophies.
2. In regard to older philosophers, then, we must confine
ourselves exclusively to the philosophical, leaving out the
historical, biographical, critical, etc.-thus disregarding
what has been written about them, what is only peripheral
to them. In this connection all sorts of extrinsic considerations
have been injected, e.g., that Thales was the first to
predict an eclipse of the sun, that Descartes and Leibniz
were skilled in mathematical analysis, etc. All such considerations
we eliminate.
By the same token the historical account of the way systems
were disseminated can be of little concern to us here.
We treat simply the content of philosophical systems, not
their extrinsic history. We know, for example, a host of
Stoic teachers who had a great influence in their own times
and even developed this or that detail. We abstract from
such details and pass over these men. To the extent that
they were famous only as teachers, the history of philosophy
is silent about them.
The second point to be taken up in the Introduction is
the relationship of philosophy to other manifestations of
spirit, the relation of its history to other histories.
94 HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
B. RELATION OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY
TO THE REST OF SPIRIT'S MANIFESTATIONS
As we know, the history of philosophy is not independent
(filr sich) but is connected with history in general, with
external history as well as with the history of religion, etc.
It is natural, then, that we should recall the principal moments
of political history, the character of the time and the
overall situation of the people, wherein philosophy comes
into being. In addition, however, the connection with general
history is internal, i.e., essential and necessary, not
merely external; nor is it merely a question of one being
simultaneous with the other (simultaneity is no relationship
at all).
There are, then, two aspects we must take into consideration:
first, the properly historical aspect of the relationship,
and, secondly, the factual connection, i.e., the connection of
philosophy itself with religion and with the other sciences
which are related to it. These two aspects are to be looked
at more in detail, in order to distinguish more precisely
the concept which characterizes philosophy.
I. The Historical Status of Philosophy
1. With regard to the historical status of philosophy the
first thing to be taken into account is the general relationship
which the philosophy of an era has with the rest of the
manifestations which characterize the same era.
It is customarily said that the political situation, religion,
mythology, etc., are to be taken account of in the history
of philosophy, because they have greatly influenced the
philosophy of an era, and, in its turn, philosophy has had
a great influence on them. If, however, one is to be content
with categories such as "great influence," the effect of one
on the other, etc., all one has to do is to show an external
connection, i.e., the point of view implies that each is for
itself, one independent of the other. Here, however, we
Hegel: Introduction 95
must take an entirely different view of this relationship:
the essential category is unity, the inner connection of these
diverse manifestations. We must be convinced that there is
only one spirit, one principle which manifests itself just
as much in the political situation as in religion, art, morality,
social relations, commerce; and industry-in such a way
that these diverse forms are but branches of one main trunk.
This is the main point of view. The spirit is only one, it is
the one substantial spirit of one period, one people, one
era, but a spirit which takes multiple forms; and these
diverse forms are the moments which are to be brought out.
It is not to be imagined that politics, civil constitutions,
religions, etc., constitute the root or the cause of philosophy,
nor that conversely the latter is the foundation of the
former. In all of these moments there is one character,
which is the foundation of all and penetrates all. No matter
how diverse the different aspects are, there is nothing contradictory
in this. No one of them contains anything heterogeneous
to the foundation, however much they may
seem to be mutually contradiCtory. They are simply shoots
coming from the same root; and philosophy is one of them.
2. Philosophy, then, is one aspect of the total manifestation
of spirit-consciousness of spirit being its supreme
flowering, since its effort is to know what spirit is. It is, in
fact, the dignity of man to know what he is and to know
this in the purest manner, i.e., to attain to the thinking of
what he is. The result of this is a revelation of the place
which philosophy holds among the other manifestations of
spirit.
a. Philosophy is identical with the spirit of the era in
which it makes its appearance; it is not superior to its era
but simply the consciousness of what is substantial in itor,
it is thinking knowledge of what belongs to that era.
By the same token an individual is not superior to his era;
g6 HEGEL'S ll>EA OF PHILOSOPHY
he is its son; what is substantial in it is his essence, he
simply manifests it in a particular form. No one can escape
from what is substantial in his era-'-any more than he can
get out of his own skin. Thus, from the substantial point of
view, philosophy cannot leap beyond its own times.
b. Nevertheless, philosophy does stand over and above its
own era, which is to say, from the point of view of form,
since it consists in the thinking of what is substantial in that
era. To the extent that it knows the substantial, i.e., makes
it an object over against itself, it has the same content but
as a knowledge of it goes beyond. The difference, however,
is simply formal; there is no difference in content.
c. Now, this very knowledge is the actuality (Wirklichkeit)
of spirit-! am only to the extent that I know myself. It is
the spirit's self-knowledge which formerly was not present.
Thus, the formal difference is also a real, actual one. This
knowledge it is, then, which produces a new form in the
development of spirit. In this context developments are
simply ways of knowing. By self-knowledge spirit posits itself
as distinct from what it is; it posits itself for itself
[as independent], develops in itself. This involves a new
difference between what it is in itself and what its actuality
is; and, thus, a new manifestation emerges. In itself, then,
philosophy is already a further determinateness or character
of spirit; it is the interior birthplace of the spirit which is
later to appear .in actuality. Its concretion emerges in the
history of philosophy itself. In this connection we shall see
that what Greek philosophy was came to actuality in the
Christian world.
Here, then, is the second determination, i.e., that philosophy
is first and foremost simply the thinking of what is
substantial in its own time, that it does not stand above that
time but only brings out its content.
Hegel: Introduction 97
3· The third thing to be taken into account with regard to
its historical situation has to do with the time when philosophy
emerges, in comparison with other manifestations
of spirit.
The spirit of an era is its substantial life; it is the spirit
as immediately vital, actual. Thus, at a time when Greek
life flourishes, we see the Greek spirit in the freshness and
strength of its youth, unaffected by decadence. The Roman
spirit we see during the era of the republic. And so it goes.
The spirit of the era is also the way a particular spirit is
present as actual vitality. Philosophy, however, is this spirit's
thinking; and thought, no matter how a priori it may
be, is essentially the result of spirit, for spirit is the vital
activity which produces itself; in its progress it produces
itself as a result. This movement contains a negation as an
essential moment. If something is to be produced, then it
must be produced from something else, and precisely that
other is negated in the movement. Thus, thinking negates
the natural way of living. The child, for example, exists as
a human being, but still immediately, naturally; education,
then, is the negation of this natural way, it is the discipline
which spirit imposes on itself in order to raise itself from
its immediacy. By the same token, thinking spirit as it
begins its movement is in its natural form. Then, as it becomes
reflective it goes beyond its natural form, i.e., it
negates it; ultimately it realizes itself by grasping itself in
concept. This is where thinking enters. The consequence of
this is that the spirit with its given [realen] norms based on
custom (Sittlichkeit), which constitute its vital force, is negated.
This means that thought, which is the spirit's substantial
manner of existing, attacks and weakens simple
custom, simple religion, etc., thus ushering in a period of
decadence. Then, with further progress, thought recollects
itself, becomes concrete, and in this way produces for itself
an ideal world in contrast to the former real one. So, when
g8 HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
philosophy is to make its appearance among a people, a
rupture must have occurred in the actual world. Then philosophy
remedies the decadence which thought had begun.
The remedial action takes place in the ideal world, the
world of spirit where man takes refuge when the earthly
world satisfies him no longer. Philosophy begins with the
decline of a real world. When it appears and-painting
gray on gray-spreads its abstractions, then is the fresh
color and vitality of youth gone. What it produces, then, is
a remedy, but only in the world of thought, not in the
earthly world. Thus the Greeks, when they began to think,
withdrew from the state; and they began to think at a time
when in the world around them there was nothing but
turbulence and wretchedness, e.g., during the time of the
Peloponnesian War. That was when the philosophers withdrew
into their thought-world; as the people said of them,
they became idlers. So it has been with almost all peoples;
philosophy makes its first appearance when public life is no
longer satisfying and ceases to hold the interest of the
people, and the citizen finds it so difficult to take any part
in government.
All this is an essential determination of philosophy,
which the history of philosophy preserves. As the Ionic
cities declined, Ionic philosophy blossomed. The external
world no longer satisfied the spirit. In the same way among
the Romans, philosophizing began with the fall of the republic,
when demagogues took over the government, and
everything was caught up in a dissolution of the old and a
striving toward the new. It was not until the decline of the
Roman Empire, which although so great, so rich, and so
imposing, was internally already dead, that the earlier
Greek philosophies experienced their highest cultivation in
the work of the Neoplatonists or Alexandrians. In similar
fashion with the decline of the Middle Ages we see the
revival of older philosophies.
Hegel: Introduction 99
This brings us to the more precise connection between
philosophy and the other forms of spirit's existence.
II. More Precise Characterization of the Relationship
between Philosophy and the Other Manifestations
of Spirit
Our second point concerns the more precise and determinate
connection between philosophy and other manifestations
of spirit. We are confronted with sciences, art, mythology,
religion, politics, etc., whose general connection with
philosophy has already been treated. Now we want to look
at the difference between philosophy and these other manifestations.
We do this by delimiting the concept of philosophy,
selecting out the moments which thus become important,
and applying them to our own subject matter which
is the history of philosophy. In so doing our purpose is to
separate off and exclude what does not belong to the subject.
It is easy enough to say that in the history of philosophy
only philosophy itself, in the process peculiar to it,
is to be considered, and that everything else, such as religion,
etc., is to be left to the side. In general that is quite
correct. Still we ask: what is philosophy? Much is put under
that heading which we must exclude. If we are to look only
at the name we should have to include much that has nothing
to do with the concept of philosophy. As for religion,
we can also say in general that we have to leave it to one
side. In history, however, religion and philosophy have frequently
been both connected with each other and in conflict
with each other-in the Greek as well as in the Christian
era-and their opposition constitutes a very definite
moment in the history of philosophy. Properly speaking,
then, philosophy only seems to leave religion aside. Historically
speaking neither has allowed the other to go untouched;
nor must we do so either.
In our investigation we want to look first at the sciences,
100 HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
or at scientific culture as such. After that we must look at
religion and particularly at the more precise relationship
between philosophy and religion. This relationship must
be looked at openly, directly, and honestly; one must not
give the impression of wanting to leave religion untouched.
To give this impression is to attempt simply to hide the
fact that philosophy has been opposed to religion. Religion
-which is to say the theologians-pretends to ignore phi·
losophy, in order not to be troubled in its own arbitrary
reasonings.
1. Relation of Philosophy to Scientific Culture as Such
We begin, then, with scientific culture as such; more precisely
with the empirical sciences, which are based on observation,
experiment, and reasoning. We must look at
them, of course, bearing in mind that this sort of thing has
also been called philosophizing. What they have in common
with philosophy, after all, is thinking. They belong
within the framework of experience, but they are also characterized
by thinking, since they strive to discover the universal
in experience. Scientific culture, then, shares its
formal aspect with philosophy. Religion, on the other hand,
shares with philosophy its other aspect, the substantial,
which is to say God, the Spirit, the Absolute. To know the
essence of this world, of truth, of the absolute Idea, is common
ground for both philosophy and religion.
With regard to the matter proper to scientific culture, on
the one hand principles have been established as to what is
to be done; this involves practical requirements (Gebote,
Pfiichten). On the other hand we recognize laws, forces,
natural classes,1 causes. Matter, then, corresponds to what
in the external world are forces and causes and to what in
1 This does not conflict with what was said in note j above.
Natural classes (Gattungen der Natur) belong to nature as determined
in thought.
Hegel: Introduction 101
the spiritual world of morality is the substantial, the motivating,
the enduring. A content such as this demands, as
does philosophy, thinking; and whatever has been thought
from this point of view has been called philosophy. Thus,
in the history of philosophy what we first meet are the
seven wise men of Greece. They, too, are called philosophers,
principally because they enunciated a number of
moral sayings and principles concerning general moral
obligations and essential relationships. Then, in more recent
times we see that man began to turn his gaze to things of
nature. That was the case particularly in the period subsequent
to that of scholastic philosophy. A priori reasoning
about the things of nature based on religion or metaphysics
was given up, and nature itself was investigated; it was observed,
and an attempt was made to know its laws and
forces. By the same token research was instituted into moral
relationships, civil law, etc.-and this was also called philosophy.
It was customary, for example, to speak of Newtonian
philosophy, even though it concerned itself principally
only with things of nature. In general, then, the form
which characterizes philosophy is one according to which,
from experience regarding nature, the state, justice, religion,
etc., general principles are derived and are enunciated
as formal, quite universal principles.
Philosophy, it is said, investigates universal causes, the
ultimate grounds of things. Thus, wherever in the sciences
universal causes, essential grounds, and principles are enunciated,
the sciences have this universality in common with
philosophy, and, to be more precise, such principles and
grounds are derived from experience and from reflection
on it (innere Empfindung). No matter how foreign to the
principle of philosophy this last may seem to be, it is nevertheless
true with regard to any philosophy that I have
received it through my senses and through reflection on
what they present to me (meine innere Empfindung)-i.e.,
through experience-and that on the basis of this expe102
HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
rience alone I consider it true. This form of knowing, of
taking into oneself, has appeared not only in opposition to
religion but also in a negative relation to other philosophies;
and this, too, was called philosophy, because it was opposed
to whatever is merely positive. Newtonian philosophy comprises
only what we now call philosophy of nature-a science
based on experience and perception, containing
knowledge of laws, forces, and universal properties of nature.
It was a great period in history which saw the emergence
of this principle of experience, when man began to see for
himself, to feel, to taste, to look on nature as worthwhile,
to rely significantly on the testimony of his senses, to hold
for true only what was known through the senses. This conviction
of the immediate certitude afforded by the senses
was the foundation for this so-called philosophy; it was
from this testimony of the senses, after all, that the sciences
of nature took their impetus. This reliance on the senses
was opposed to previous ways of looking at nature; formerly
the point of departure had been metaphysical principles.
Because men now based their procedures on sensible representations
they came into conflict with religion and the
state. It was, however, not merely the testimony of the
senses which they had set up against a metaphysics of the
understanding; still another testimony was highly regarded
-namely, that the true could count as true only to the extent
that it was to be found in both the heart and the understanding
of man. Through this kind of understanding,
this thinking and feeling for himself, there resulted an even
greater opposition to what was merely positive in religion
and contemporary government. Man learned now to do his
own observing and thinking, to form his own representations,
opposing them to the fixed truths and dogmas of the
Church and to then-accepted civil law-or at least he
sought new principles to support the old civil law, in order
to justify it in the light of these principles. In the precise
Hegel: Introduction 10~
context in which religion is positive had been found the
validation of those principles according to which subjects
owed obedience to the authority of the princes; it was the
divine authority which gave validity to these principles,
because rulers were appointed by God. The basis for this
was found in the Jewish laws according to which kings were
the anointed of the Lord. (The Mosaic laws had a special
validity even with regard to marriage.) Against this whole
positive position, against whatever had been imposed by
authority, man's own proper understanding and free thinking
rebelled. Among those who thought this way can be
counted Hugo Grotius who formulated a law of nations
based on what was accepted as law by all peoples, i.e., the
consensus gentium. According to this law the purpose of
the state was posited as something proper to the state itself,
as something immanent in man, rather than based on a
divine command. What was accepted as law was derived
from what is the ground for man's being recognized as
man, whereas previously everything had been regulated by
authoritarian legislation (nach dem Positiven). Positing
in this way a ground other than that of authority was
called philosophizing, and for this reason philosophy was
also called world-wisdom. Because this kind of philosophizing
had as its object external nature and the rights of human
nature, and because a content such as this owed its
origin to the activity of man's mundane understanding and
reason, it was correct to call this world-wisdom. There is
no question that philosophy does not limit itself to internal
objects; it extends its interest to everything in the surrounding
world and, thus, is occupied with mundane, finite
things. On the other hand, however, it does not confine
itself to the mundane; it has the same goal as religion; and
the mundane which it has as its object is nonetheless a
determinateness of the divine Idea. In recent times Schlegel
has warmed over again the term world-wisdom as a name
for philosophy. He intended it, however, ironically; what
104 HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
he meant was that philosophy must give way, when there
is question of higher things-for example, of religion. In
this he has had a number of followers.
In England under the heading of philosophy is understood
natural science. Thus it happens that a journal (like
Hermbstiidts journal), for example, which talks about agriculture
(manure), economics, industry, chemistry, etc., and
tells about discoveries in these areas, is called a philosophical
review. By the same token optical instruments, barometers,
thermometers, etc., are called philosophical instruments.
Even theories, especially those concerned with morality,
which are derived more from the feelings of the
human heart and from experience than from the concept
or from determinations of what is right, in England belong
to philosophy. The Scottish moral philosophers in particular
should be mentioned in this connection; they reason
in a Ciceronian manner, taking as their starting point
drives, inclinations, and immediate certainty, i.e., from the
sort of thing which Cicero calls insitum natura. In the same
way modern English theories of political economy, e.g., that
of Adam Smith and of those influenced by him, are counted
as philosophy. The result is that, at least in England, the
name philosophy is respected, because there whatever is
derived from general principles or can be taken out of the
realm of experience and brought back to determinate principles
is called philosophical. A short time ago a banquet
was held in honor of Canning. In his speech of acknowledgment
it comes out that he congratulates England, because
there philosophical principles are employed in government.
Thus, in England at least, philosophy is not a term used
ironically.
Now, even though all these ways of viewing things go
under the heading of philosophy, we must exclude them
from our treatment of the subject, despite the fact that in
all of them there is a principle which they have in common
with philosophy, i.e., that in them it is one's self which
Hegel: Introduction 105
sees, senses, thinks, is present. Whatever the area may be,
this is the great principle opposed to authority. In perception
it is I myself who perceive; and the same is true of
sensing, understanding, thinking. What is to have signifi"
cance for man must be contained in his own thinking.
Properly speaking, "in his own thinking" is a pleonasm;
every man must think for himself, no one can think for
another, any more than he can eat or drink for another.
It is this moment of the self, plus the form which is produced
in thinking, the form of universal laws, principles,
fundamental determinations, in short the form of universality,
that philosophy has in common with those sciences,
philosophical points of view, representations, etc., of which
we have been speaking; they are what has given to all of
them the name philosophy.
2. Relation of Philosophy to Religion
The second sphere of those manifestations of spirit which
are more closely related to philosophy is the area of religious
representations in general. Here belongs primarily
religion as such, then mythology and the mysteries, and
even to a certain extent poetry. Just as the first area of
which we spoke had in common with philosophy its formal
element, the I and the form of universality, so what is
common here is the other side, i.e., the substantial element,
the content.
In the various religions, peoples have lett a record of the
way they thought regarding the being of the world, the absolute,
that which is in and for itself. There we find what
they held to be the cause, the essence, the substantial, in
both nature and spirit. There, too, we discover their opinions
regarding the manner in which human spirit or human
nature is related to such objects-to the divinity, the true.
In religion, then, we immediately observe two characteristics
(Bestimmungen): first, how man is conscious of God,
i.e., how in consciousness he represents God, this being the
106 HEGEL'S lnEA OF PHILOSOPHY
objective form or determination of thought whereby man
sets the essence of divinity over against himself, represents
it as something other than himself, as an alien being in the
beyond. The second characteristic is to be found in devotion
and cult, which constitute the overcoming of this
opposition, whereby man raises himself to God and becomes
conscious of his unity with God's being. This is the
sense which cult has in all religions. Among the Greeks cult
served rather to raise them to an enjoyment of this unity,
since for them the being of God was not in itself something
beyond them.
Religion and philosophy, then, have as an object in common
what is true in and for itself-God, insofar as He is
in and for Himself-and man in his relation to God. In
religions, men have made manifest the consciousness they
had concerning the supreme being. To this extent religions
are the supreme work of reason. Thus it is absurd to believe
that priests invented religion in order to deceive the
people-as though men would permit anything to be imposed
on them with regard to the ultimate and supreme
being.
Although philosophy has the same object as religion, still
in relation to each other they have developed many differences.
The first question, then, is: how does philosophy
differ from theology and religion6 in general? The second
is: to what extent must we in the history of philosophy take
the religious into account?
a. The Form of Philosophy Distinguished from That of
Religion. First, then, the question how philosophy and religion
differ from each other. In this connection I intend
to present their general characteristics and-so far as possible-
discuss them.
0 Alternate reading in the Michelet edition: "How
does philosophy differ from theology (knowledge of
religion) or from religion (as consciousness)?"
(Glockner, XIII, So).
Hegel: Introduction
b. Divine and Human Spirit. Common to both is what is
in and for itself, the universal, absolute Spirit. This is spirit,
but at the same time it includes nature within itself; it is
itself and the grasp of nature within itself. It is not identical
with nature in the superficial sense in which the chemically
neutral is, but is rather in its own self identical with
nature, or one with itself in nature. Such is its identity with
nature that the latter, its negative, the real, is posited only
as ideal. That is the idealism of spirit. The universality of
spirit, to which both philosophy and religion are related, is
absolute, not exterior, universality. It is a universality
which penetrates everything, is present in everything. We
have to represent spirit to ourselves as free, and freedom
of the spirit means that it is with itself, has a rational
awareness of itself. Its nature is to grasp the other in such
a comprehensive way as to find itself in the other, to unite
itself with itself in the other, there to possess and enjoy
itself.
Here, then, is manifested the relationship of Spirit to the
human spirit. No matter how fragile and isolated individuality
may be :represented, abstraction must simply be made
from this sort of atomistic representation. When spirit is
represented in truth it is what is rationally aware of itself
(das sich selbst Vernehmende). The difference between the
individual and the universal, then, is so to be expressed,
that the subjective, individual spirit is the universal divine
Spirit, to the extent that there is rational awareness of the
latter, to the extent that the latter manifests itself in each
subject, each man. The spirit which is rationally aware of
absolute Spirit is, then, the subjective spirit.
I£ we take this determination as our point of departure,
then as further determinations we have simply various
forms of this rational awareness. What we call religious
belief is the substantial, universal manner in which man is
rationally aware of the divine Spirit. Apart from belief the
divine Spirit is not what he is according to the teaching of
108 HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
the Church. In this way the divine Spirit is not in himself
but is present in the spirit of man, in the spirit of those
who belong to his community. Then it is that the individual
spirit is rationally aware of the divine Spirit, i.e., of
the essence of his own spirit, of his own essence, of what is
substantial in him; and this essence is precisely the universal
in and for itself, the enduring. That is the faith of
the Evangelical Church-not an historical (historischer)
faith, not a belief in historical (geschichtliche) things;
rather this Lutheran faith is the spirit's own faith, the consciousness
whereby it is rationally aware of the substantial
in spirit. According to a recent theory of faith it is said: I
believe, I have immediate knowledge that I have a body.
This, then, is called belief, that something determinate,
some content or other is immediately in us, is produced in
our consciousness. That is belief in the external sense. But
the internal, the religious sense of belief is precisely the
knowledge of the absolute Spirit of which we have been
speaking; and this knowledge, as it is first of all in the
human spirit, is immediate and, as a result, is immediate
certitude. It is simply a testimony of man's spirit, which is
the profound root of the identity of spirit in general. Spirit
generates (erzeugt) itself, manifests its own self, shows itself
and gives testimony of itself also, of its unity with itself.
It also has consciousness of itself, consciousness of its unity
with its object, because it is itself its own object. Now, when
consciousness of this object comes on the scene, develops,
and takes form, the content in question can seem to be
something given in sensation, sensibly represented, coming
from outside; the way in mythology a myth has of coming
into being according to an historical pattern. This pattern
is external. To faith, however, belongs the testimony of the
spirit. The content can, of course, come from outside, be
given and received, but the spirit must give testimony to it.
To be more precise and to speak of the Christian religion,
we know that Christ came into the world almost 2000 years
Hegel: Introduction 109
ago. He said, however, "I am with you all days, even to the
end of the world," 7 and "Where two or three are gathered
together in my name, I am there in the midst of them." 8
Still, this was not to be the sensible presence of this individual
person. He also said, when I am no longer with you,
"the Spirit will lead you to all truth," 9 i.e., the relation of
externality must first be removed; it is not the true relationship.
Herein we find an elucidation (Erkliirung) of what
we said above.
On the one hand we have to do there with a representative
consciousness, where the content is an object, and it is
outside us, separated from us. On the other hand we have
devotion, cult, the feeling of union with this object. The
result is a certain ambiguity; at one time externality is
stronger, at another, devotion. At one time the indwelling
Christ is sent back 2000 years to Palestine and is simply an
historical person in that land and those surroundings. At
another time, however, in devotion and in cult, the feeling
of His presence is predominant. Consequently, at this point
there is to be found a contrast in religion.
c. Representation and Thought. The form of philosophy
differs from the aforementioned form of religion, and we
must now get a more precise understanding of this difference.
The fundamental connection between religion and
philosophy is the nature of spirit itself.
(1) With regard to spirit the point of departure must be
[the realization] that spirit is in manifesting itself; it is this
one substantial identity, but at the same time, in manifesting
itself it is differentiated within itself. This is where its
subjective, finite consciousness comes in. (That which has
1 Matt. 28:20.
8 Matt. 18:20.
• John 16:13.
110 HEGEL's IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
its limit in another, because at its limit the other begins,
is finite; and this is true only where there is a determination,
a difference.) Spirit, however, remains free; it remains
with itself in being manifested, with the result that it is
not disturbed by reason of the difference. To spirit, that
which is differentiated is transparent; it is something clear,
not something obscure. To put it another way, for spirit
there is nothing determinate in the sense that determination
means difference. Now, when there is talk of a limit
to spirit, from one point of view this is correct; man is limited,
dependent, finite-except insofar as he is spirit. Finitude
has to do with the other modes of his existence. To the
extent that, even though he is spirit, his attitude is spiritless,
he is involved with external things; but when he is
spirit and truly spirit he is unlimited. The limits of reason
are only the limits of this subject's reason; but when man's
attitude is genuinely rational he is without limits, infinite.
(Of course, infinity is not to be taken in the abstract sense,
as a concept of understanding.) Because spirit is infinite it
continues to be spirit in all its relationships, expressions,
manifestations. The difference between universal, substantial
spirit and merely subjective spirit is a difference for
spirit itself. Both spirit as object and the content of spirit
must be at the same time immanent in subjective spirit;
and this can be only when the immanence is spiritual, not
natural or immediate. This is the fundamental characteristic
of Christianity, which sees man illuminated by grace,
by the Holy Spirit (who is essential Spirit). Then it is that
the spirit is immanent in man, is, thus, his own spirit. A
living spirit such as this is, is, so to speak, phosphorus, the
volatile, flammable material which can be ignited both
from without and from within. It is ignited from without,
for example, when man is taught the content of religion,
when his emotions and imagination (Vorstellung) are
aroused by such a teaching, or when he accepts it on authority.
When his attitude is spiritual, he is on the contrary
Hegel: Introduction 111
inflamed from within himself; because he looks for the
content of religion within himself, it is from out of himself
that he manifests it. Then he is his most intimate self.
(2) To go further, we must speak of the way in which
spirit is objective to itself, of what it is for it to be for itself.
The form in which it is present can vary; thus it can assume
a variety of forms. From these diverse ways of appearing
(Gestaltungsweisen) comes the diversity of forms of
spirit and, thus, the difference between philosophy and
religion.
In religion, spirit has its own peculiar form, which can
be sensible, e.g., in the form of art, when art pictures divinity,
or in poetry, where likewise the sensible representation
constitutes the essence of the being-present. In general we
can say that this way of manifesting spirit is representation.
It is true, of course, that in religious representation thinking,
too, is to some extent involved, but the representation
contains thought in such a way that the latter is mingled
with an ordinary external content. By the same token, law
and morality too are, as it is said, suprasensible, but my
representation of them takes its origin from custom, from
legal prescriptions (Bestimmungen) which are already there,
or from feeling. With regard to philosophy, then, the difference
is that in it the same content is grasped, but the
form is that of thinking. In religion there are two moments:
(x) there is an objective form or determination of consciousness,
whereby essential Spirit, the absolute, is present as
external to subjective spirit, i.e., as its object, and is represented
as historical or as an artistic image, separated in
time and space; (2) there is the character or stage of devotion,
of intimacy, wherein the separation is removed, the
gap is bridged, wherein Spirit and object are one, and the
individual is filled with the Spirit. Philosophy and religion
have the same object, the same content, the same goal. But,
what are in religion two stages, two modes of objectivity,
Ill! HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
i.e., art, faith and then devotion,m are in philosophy united
into one; for thought is (a) from the point of view of the
first character objective and has the form of an object;
whereas (b) it has also lost the form of objectivity, such that
in thinking, content and form are posited as unified. To the
extent that what I think-i.e., the content of thinking-is
in the form of thought, it no longer stands over against me.
In religion and philosophy, then, there is one substantial
content, and only the manner of manifesting it in each is
different. These two manifestations, however, are not
merely different; in their difference they can appear to be
opposed, even contradictory, because the content is represented
as essentially linked to the image. Still, even within
the framework of religion it is conceded that the different
manner of presentation which characterizes religion is not
to be taken literally. Thus, it is said: God generated His
Son. The divine Spirit's self-knowledge, His making Himself
into an object, is here called generating His Son. In the
Son the Father knows Himself, because the Son is of the
same nature as He. This relationship, however, is taken
from vital nature, not from the spiritual; its expression is
characteristic of representation.n It is said, of course, that
the relationship is not to be taken literally; but it is simply
left at that. So too, when the mythologies speak of the wars
of the gods, it is admitted that this sort of thing is being
said partly of spiritual and partly too of natural forces. Because
they are opposed to each other they are in this way
imaginatively represented.
(3) It is natural that these diverse forms, as for the first
time they appear in a determinate way, and are aware of
m Kunst, Glaube und Andacht. What Hegel calls "two" modes
might here seem to be three. Art and belief, however, as objectifying
the Absolute-the one in sensible form and the other in the
form of representation--constitute one stage or mode. Devotion,
then, is a second.
n Vorstellung can in this context take on the connotation of
"metaphor."
Hegel: Introduction
the differences which separate them, should be inimical to
each other; it is, in fact, inevitable. Thought, after all, first
makes its appearance as abstract, i.e., as formally incomplete.
The same is true of religion, since initial immediate
religious consciousness, even though it is consciousness of
spirit, of that which is in and for itself, still involves a sensible
form and sensible attributes, i.e., it too is abstract.
Thereafter thinking becomes more concrete, penetrates
more profoundly into itself, and brings to consciousness the
concept of spirit as such. Thus aware of itself, it is no longer
inseparable from its abstract determination. The concept
of concrete spirit is its own self-conception, or it involves
an essential conception of itself, having determination in
itself (determination being what is counted as belonging to
understanding, to the essence of appearance). Within itself
abstract understanding denies all determination and, thus,
with regard to God retains what is left, which is no more
than His abstract designation as supreme being. On the
contrary, the concrete concept has nothing to do with such
a caput mortuum; its object is concrete, active, self-determining,
living spirit. Subsequently, therefore, concrete
spirit recognizes in religion the concrete, determinateness in
general, not the sensible but the essential. The Jewish God,
for example, God the Father, is abstract. In a later stage of
its development spirit recognizes what is essential in that.
The concrete, however, is not merely God as such, but
rather God determining Himself, positing another than
Himself, and yet as Spirit He does not leave the other simply
another but is with Himself in this other. Only this
latter is the complete divine Spirit. What is concrete in
religion, however, can be known and recognized only in the
concept which is itself concrete. Therein lies the possibility
of reconciling religion and philosophy, when abstract understanding
struggles against the former.
The historical progress of this opposition is approximately
the following. Thinking takes its start at first within
HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
religion's representations and subsequently parallels them,
with the result that the opposition is not yet conscious.
Later, however, when thinking is strengthened and relies
on itself, it declares its opposition to the form of religion
and will not recognize its own concept therein, seeking as
it does only itself. This fight against the form of religion
took place early in the history of the Greek world. In as
early a case as Xenophanes' we see a philosopher most vigorously
combating the representations of Greek popular
religion; and later we see the opposition stiffen, as philosophers
arose who expressly denied the gods and hence the
divine character of the popular religion. Socrates was
charged with having introduced new gods. As a matter of
fact, his Satp,bvwv and the overall principle of his system
were contrary to the form of Greek religion and of customary
morality. Still, he held on to the practices of his
religion, and we know that as he was dying he ordered
that a cock be sacrificed to Aesculapius. It was only very
late that the Neoplatonists recognized the universal content
of the popular religion, which had been either expressly
attacked or put aside by the philosophers. We see
not only that the Neoplatonists gave to mythological representations
a meaning proper to thought but that they also
employed these representations as a sort of imaginative
language for their own system.
The path which this opposition follows in the Christian
religion is quite similar. At first thinking is dependent, unfree,
tied to the religious form. Thus it is with the Church
Fathers. With them, thinking develops the elements of
Christian doctrine. (The latter becomes a system only in
the hand's of the Church Fathers who were also philosophers.
The developed aspect of ecclesiastical faith emerged
in a special way in Luther's time. At that time and frequently
thereafter in more recent times there was a desire
to effect a return of Christian religion to its primitive form.
This sort of thing has, it is true, a good sense, in that men
Hegel: Introduction
were concerned with what is authentic and original in
Christian teaching, something which was particularly necessary
at the time of the Reformation. Nevertheless, it also
involves the incorrect notion that the elements should not
be developed.) The first step, then, was that thinking expanded
the teaching and developed it into a system; subsequently
the doctrine was fixed and made into an absolute
presupposition for thinking. First, then, comes the development
of doctrine; secondly comes its fixation. Only after
that does the opposition of believing and thinking, of immediate
doctrinal certitude and so-called reason, enter in.
Thinking reached the point where it relied only on itself;
the first thing the young eagle of reason did was to soar as
a bird o£ prey to the sun of truth, from there to declare war
on religion. Then, however, once more justice is done to
the religious content also, in that thinking finds its completion
in the concrete concept of spirit and enters into a
polemic against abstract understanding.
Religion, then, has a content common to itself and to
philosophy; it differs from philosophy only in its form.
Thus, all that is required for philosophy is that the form
of the concept be so far perfected as to be able to comprise
the content of religion. This content is primarily what have
been called the mysteries of religion, which is to say, the
speculative element in religion. Under that heading is understood
first of all something mysterious, something which
must remain secret and is not to be made known. It is true,
of course, that by their nature, i.e., precisely as a speculative
content, mysteries are something mysterious for understanding;
not, however, for reason. They are, in fact, precisely
the rational element, in the sense of being speculative,
i.e., in the sense of the concrete concept. Philosophy is
opposed to rationalism, particularly in contemporary theology.
Rationalism, it is true, is always talking about reason,
but what it is really talking about is merely dry, abstract
understanding. Nothing in it is recognizable as reason, ex116
HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
cept the moment of self-thinking; but even that is a completely
abstract thinking. This sort of rationalism is opposed
to philosophy both in its content and in its form.
From the point of view of content: it has made heaven
empty-reduced the divine to a caput mortuum, and everything
else to mere finite entities in space and time. Even
from the point of view of form it is contrary to philosophy;
for the form of this rationalism is ratiocination (Riisonnieren),
unfree argumentation, and it declares its opposition
to philosophy in particular, in order to be able to continue
this sort of argumentation forever. That is no philosophizing,
no genuine conceptual thinking (Begreifen).
Within religion the opposition to rationalism comes from
supranaturalism, and this latter is in regard to true content
like philosophy and in agreement with it, but different as
regards form; for in supranaturalism the spirit is entirely
absent, it has become wooden and accepts only positive
authority for its corroboration and justification. The Scholastics,
on the contrary, were not this sort of supranaturalists;
in their thinking they put the dogma of the Church
into the form of concept.
As a thinking of this content in the form of concept, over
against the representation which is proper to religion, philosophy
has the advantage of understanding both. It understands
religion and can accord it a justification; it understands
rationalism and supranaturalism too; and it also
understands itself. The converse, however, is not true; religion
as such, because its point of view is that of the representation,
recognizes itself only in representation, and
not in philosophy, i.e., not in concepts, not in universal
thought-determinations. Often enough no injustice is being
done to a philosophy when the complaint is made that it
is opposed to religion; frequently, however, the complaint
is also unjustified, namely, when the complaint is made
from the religious point of view, simply because religion
does not understand philosophy.
Hegel: Introduction
Philosophy, then, is not contrary to religion; it grasps the
latter in concept. For the absolute Idea, however, for absolute
Spirit there must be the form of religion, for religion
is the form proper to consciousness of the true, the way it
is for all men. The structure of religion is ( 1) sense perception,
and (2) mingling with the latter the form of the universal,
i.e., reflection, thinking, but still, abstract thinking,
which still contains much that is external. Thereafter a
transition is made to the concrete structuring of thoughts,
there is speculation on the true, which is then in consciousness
according to its true form. Nevertheless, the speculative
element which enters into the structuring at this point
is not the externally universal form of thinking which is
common for all men; and so the consciousness of that which
is in itself true must have the religious form.
This is the general justification of the religious form
[of spirit's manifestation].0
Up to this point we have given an account of the difference
between philosophy and religion. With regard, however,
to what we want to treat of in the history of philosophy
there are a few further remarks to make in connection
with-and partly as a consequence of-what has already
been said.
3· The Kinds of Religious Contents which Are to be
Eliminated from Philosophical Consideration
a. The first remark concerns the simply (ilberhaupt) mythological.
It is said that mythology contains philosophical
affirmations, and, it is also said, since in general religious
forms of expression involve philosophical affirmations, philosophy
must concern itself with such forms of expression.
(1) In this regard the work of my friend Creuzer is well
known; therein in a distinctively philosophical way he
• Cf. Appendix.
118 HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
treated mythology and in general the religious representations,
expressions, and usages of ancient peoples, showing
what was rational in them. Now this method of treatment
is attacked by others as an incorrect and unhistorical procedure.
The objection is that it is not an historical fact
that such philosophical affirmations are contained therein.
Included in the mythological are also the mystery religions
of the ancients, and in them we are presented with perhaps
more philosophical affirmations than in mythology. That
objection has already been taken care of by what was said
earlier. It is clear enough that in mythology and in the
mystery religions of the ancients such thoughts are to be
found, since religions and, by the same token, the mythological
elements in them are products of man, wherein he
has bequeathed to posterity (niedergelegt hat) what to him
was supreme and most profound-his consciousness of what
the true is. Consequently there is no question that in the
forms of mythology are contained reason, universal notions
and determinations, and hence philosophical affirmations
also. Now, when Creuzer is faulted for introducing such
thoughts where they are not really present, for allegorizing,
it is important to note that Creuzer shares with the Neoplatonists
the tendency to seek philosophical affirmations in
the mythological. That does not, however, mean injecting
such elements; they are actually there. This sort of consideration,
then, is rational and is to be raised to the absolute
level. The religions and mythologies which peoples have
developed are products of reason becoming conscious of
itself. No matter how nai"ve or nonsensical they may seem,
they still contain the rational moment; instinctive rationality
is fundamental to them. The method employed by
Creuzer and the N eoplatonists, then, is to be recognized as
in itself the true and essential method.
Because, however, the mythological is the sensible, contingent
presentation of the concept, what has been thought
about it or developed out of it always continues to be
Hegel: Introduction 119
bound to its external form. But the sensible is not the genuine
element in which thought or concept can be presented.
This sort of presentation, then, is always inadequate to the
concept. The sensible form must always be described from
many sides, e.g., from those of history, of nature, and of art.
It involves so much by way of contingent addition, which
makes it fail to correspond exactly with the concept and,
in fact, to contradict the intrinsic concept. Nevertheless the
Neoplatonists did achieve a new recognition of their own
philosophy under the sensible image proper to mythology,
and they employed such images as forms for the expression
of their own concepts. It is natural to assume that in the
explanation of those images, even when they are connected
with an intrinsic concept, a good deal of error gets in,
especially when it comes down to details, to the multitude
of usages, activities, utensils, vestments, ritual sacrifices, etc.
Therein can be found something analogous to thought, a
relationship to thought; but this simply shows how separate
from each other are the image and its significance and
how much contingency and arbitrariness can intervene and
obscure the issue. Still, there is rationality here, and it must
be taken into consideration. It is to be excluded, however,
from our examination of the history of philosophy, for in
philosophy we have nothing to do with such vague philosophical
affirmations-i.e., with general ways of representing
the true--or with thoughts which are merely contained
in some presentation or other or lie hidden and undeveloped
under some sensible image. We are concerned with
thoughts which are externalized and only to the extent to
which they are externalized-to the extent, then, that the
sort of content proper to religion has appeared, been manifested,
and come to consciousness. The difference is enormous.
In a child, too, reason is present, but only as a capacity.
In the history of philosophy, however, we are concerned
with reason only insofar as it has been articulated
in the form of thought. The philosophical affirmations
120 HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
which are contained only implicite in religion, then, do not
concern us.
(2) We can also believe that many philosophical affirmations
were to be found in the mystery religions; in any
event they presented symbolically adumbrations of later,
superior representations. Still, a good deal of the sensible
is mingled in them. They probably belong to the very ancient
remnants of nature-religion which have, in fact, retreated
into darkness. In general what is retained in the
mystery religions belongs to a stage of culture far below
that to which the people have attained. In the Christian
religion, mysteries essentially contain the speculative. The
Neoplatonists called the speculative concept mystical. The
terms f.LVEtv, f.LVE'iaBat (consecrate oneself, be consecrated) signified
to be engaged in speculative philosophy. Consequently
there is nothing unknown in these mysteries; their
name signifies not something hidden (Geheimnis) but
rather consecration. Thus, all Athenians were consecrated
into the Eleusinian mysteries (and philologically speaking
the same observation is to be made, for the same notion
[Vorstellung] holds there); Socrates alone is an exception.
The only thing that was forbidden was to reveal these
things publicly before strangers; with regard to some of
them it was made a crime to do so. What we find in the
Christian religion is similar; there dogmas are called mysteries.
They are what is known of God's nature and disseminated
as doctrine. Thus, a mystery is not something unknown
or hidden; it is something revealed, familiar, what
everyone in the community knows; and it is by this knowledge
that they are distinguished from members of other religions.
Here, too, then, mysterium does not mean secret
(since every Christian is in on the secret); it is simply
another name for the speculative. For the senses, for sensual
man with his desires and his ordinary understanding, it is,
of course, a secret; for understanding finds only contradicHegel:
Introduction 121
tions anywhere in the speculative; it finds difference impenetrable
and cannot grasp the concrete. Mysterium, or the
idea, however, is at the same time the resolution of contradictions.
We are here concerned with mysteries, then, only
to the extent that in them thought as thought, articulated
in the form of thought, is present.
b. Mythical Philosophizing. It can also be claimed that
myths are a way of philosophizing; and that they have also
often been so. Mythical language is also deliberately used,
as it is said, in order to evoke sublime ideas. Plato, for example,
employs many myths. Jacobi, too, belongs to this
number, since he employs the forms of Christian religion
in his philosophizing and in this manner says the most
speculative things. This form, however, is not the correct
one or the one which suits philosophy. Thought which has
itself as object must be, in its form too, object for itself; it
has to have risen above its natural form and to have appeared
also in the form of thought. There is a fairly prevalent
opinion that Plato's myths are superior to his more
abstract mode of expression; nor is there any question that
Plato does present them beautifully. When we consider
them more carefully we see that his myths are partly the
result of an inability to get thought across to human beings
in a purer form. Partly, too, Plato speaks this way only to
introduce his themes-when he comes to the principal
theme, however, his manner of expression is different. Aristotle
says: "Those who philosophize mythically do not deserve
to be taken seriously." 10 That is true. Still, when
Plato employs myths he certainly has good reasons for so
doing. In general, however, the mythical form is not the
one in which thought is best portrayed; it is only a subordinate
way.

is correct.]
122 HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
Just as the Freemasons have symbols which count as deep
wisdom-deep in the way that we call a well deep when we
cannot see the bottom-so men are easily convinced that
what is hidden is deep. But, when something is concealed,
it may well be the case that there is nothing behind the
concealment. Thus, among the Freemasons what is totally
hidden (not only from outsiders but also from insiders) is
really nothing and requires neither a special wisdom nor
science. It belongs precisely to thought, on the other hand,
to manifest itself; it is its very nature to be clear. Manifestation
is not, so to speak, a situation which can take
place or not, such that thought would continue to be
thought whether manifested or not-manifestation is its
very being. [This paragraph inserted from Michelet's first
edition of 1833·]
Others have employed lines, numbers, and geometrical
figures as symbols. A snake biting its own tail, for example,
or a circle count as symbols of eternity. Such a symbol
is a sensible image; spirit, however, does not need that
sort of symbol, it has language. If spirit can express itself
in the element proper to thought, then the symbolic is an
incorrect, a false mode of presentation. When we talk
about Pythagoras we shall come back to this point. This
sort of thing is found among the Chinese, too; they use
lines and numbers to signify thoughts.
So, the mythical as such and mythical forms of philosophizing
are excluded from what we have to say.
c. The Place of Thoughts in Poetry and Religion. The
third remark to be made is that religion as such, like poetry,
contains thoughts. The form in which religion is presented
is not merely that of art, as it is particularly in Greek religion;
rather it contains thoughts, universal notions. By the
same token, poetry (i.e.,. the art whose element is language)
attains to the expression of thoughts; in poets, too, we find
profound universal thoughts. Thoughts such as these-e.g.,
Hegel: Introduction
on fate in Homer and the Greek tragedians, or on living
and dying, being and ceasing to be, birth and death-then,
are clearly abstract and important thoughts, which also
are often imaginatively presented, for example, in Indian
poetry. Still, in the history of philosophy we are not to
consider this mode of presentation either. One could speak
of a philosophy of Aeschylus, of Euripides, of Schiller, of
Goethe, etc. But, such thoughts are to an extent merely
incidental and, thus, not germane to our presentation; they
constitute general ways of representing the true, the vocation
of man, morality, etc. To an extent, also, these thoughts
have not attained to the form which is proper to them; and
the form which is required is that of thought, wherein what
is expressed must be the ultimate and constitute the absolute
foundation. With regard to the thoughts we have just
spoken about that is not the case; in them there is an
absence of distinction from and relation to each other.
Besides, in the case of the Indians, whatever has a relation
to thought is shot through with confusion.
In addition we are not concerned with those thoughts
which have their source in Christian religion or in the
Church. The Fathers of the Church were, it is true, great
philosophers, and the growth of Christianity owes a great
deal to them. Still, their philosophizing moves within the
framework of an already fixed and given doctrinal concept
which is fundamental to it. In the same way we do not see
among the Scholastics the sort of free thought which develops
from itself and builds upon itself; rather we see that
their thought is tied to all sorts of presuppositions.
This, then, is what I wanted to say by way of introduction
to our treatment of the history of philosophy. Two
points in particular have been emphasized in what we have
said about the relationship which these last types of thinking
have to philosophy. One of these concerned the formal
element, self-thinking in general as it occurs in the natural
sciences, in what might be called popular philosophy. In
124 HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
that case it was the form which is common to them and to
philosophy; whereas the determination of content, the
matter, is not developed from the thought itself, but comes
from elsewhere, from nature or from feeling, or, as is often
the case, sound common sense (Menschenverstand) is
adopted as a criterion (as in Scottish philosophy). The other
aspect was the substantial, which religion in particular
shares with philosophy. In this case, however, what is lacking
to the substantial element is the form of thought. Thus,
what remains for philosophy is simply the substantial element
in the form of thought.
C. GENERAL DIVISION OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY
I. The Beginning of the History of Philosophy
The question now to be asked is: where is the history of
philosophy to begin? The answer to this question is already
contained immediately in what has preceded. The history of
philosophy begins where thought in its freedom comes into
existence, where it cuts itself loose from its immersion in
and unity with nature, constitutes itself for itself, where
thinking goes into itself and remains with itself.
From the historical point of view this emergence of
spirit is intimately connected with the flowering of political
liberty; and political liberty, liberty within the state, begins
where the individual feels himself to be an individual,
where the subject knows himself in a universal manner, or
where the consciousness of personality, of having in oneself
infinite value, comes into the open-because I posit
myself for myself and have value simply for myself. Herein
is contained, too, free thinking of the object, the absolute,
the essential universal object. To think means to put something
into the form of universality. To think oneself, then,
means to give oneself the determination of universality,
to know oneself as universal-to know that I am a universal,
an infinite-i.e., to know oneself as a free being relating
Hegel: Introduction
oneself to oneself. That is precisely where the moment of
practical political freedom comes in. Philosophical thinking
is immediately connected with this sort of thing because
it, too, appears as thought of the universal object. Thought
is determined as something universal; which means (a) it
makes of the universal its object or of the objective something
universal. It determines the individuality of natural
things, the way they are in sensible consciousness, as a uni~
versa!, a thought, an objective thought. There we have
the objective, but as thought. (b) Added to this is the second
determination: I recognize this universal, thought knows
that the universal happens. This more precise relation of
recognition and of knowledge to the universal enters in
only to the extent that the objective in question continues
to be for me the objective and that I continue to grasp
myself for myself. Insofar as I think the objective, it is
mine; and even though it is my thinking, it counts for me
as the absolutely universal. Insofar as it is present as objective,
I have thought myself in it; I myself am contained in
this infinite and at the same time I am conscious of this.
Thus, I retain the standpoint of objectivity and at the same
time that of knowing, and I maintain the latter standpoint.
That, in general, is the connection between political freedom
and the emergence of freedom of thought.
Philosophy, then, makes its appearance in history when
there exist free political institutions.P In this connection the
Orient first comes to mind. In the Oriental world, however,
there can be no question of philosophy properly speaking:
for, to characterize the situation briefly, spirit does arise in
the Orient, but conditions are such that the subject, the
individuality, is not a person, but is determined as being
P Verfassungen. Literally the word means "constitutions," but
here it stands for the political entities regulated by constitutions.
From his earliest years, Hegel was concerned with constitutional
government, the only form of government in which he saw the
freedom of the people guaranteed by their participation in legislating
the laws which bind them.
HEGEL's IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
swallowed up in the objective. There the substantial relation
is dominant. There substance is represented partly as
suprasensible, as thought, partly as more on the side of
the material. The relation which the individual or the particular
has, then, is simply that of being a negative over
against the substantial. The highest which such an individual
can achieve is eternal blessedness, which consists in
being simply submerged in this substance, in abdicating
consciousness, and thus being annihilated as subject, with
a consequent destruction of the difference between substance
and subject. The supreme relationship, then, is unconsciousness.
Now, insofar as individuals have not attained
this blessedness but exist still in an earthly way they are
excluded from the unity of the substantial and the individual.
The relation they have is that of being determined
as without spirit, without substance and-as regards political
freedom-without rights. Will in this case is not substantial
will but only one which is determined by the
arbitrariness and contingency of nature (e.g., by the caste
system); it is a being without inner consciousness.
There is the fundamental situation of the Oriental character.
What is affirmative is simply substance, and the individual
is without substance, it is accidental. Political liberty,
rights, moral freedom, pure consciousness, thinking-all
are absent. If these are to come about, it is necessary that
the subject, too, posit himself as consciousness over against
the substance and be recognized for what he is. But, in the
Oriental character the subject does not count as thus
knowing himself. The subject is not there for himself and
he has in his own self-consciousness no value for himself.
The Oriental subject can, it is true, be great, noble, sublime;
still what characterizes him chiefly is that as an individual
he is without rights and that what he makes of himself
is determined either by nature or by arbitrariness. Nobility,
sublimity, the utmost magnanimity of attitude, are
.among the Orientals arbitrariness of character and by the
Hegel: Introduction
same toK.en contingent. Missing are such things as rights and
moral standards, which consist in objective and positive
determinations, to be respected by all, are valid for all, and
in which all are accorded recognition. When the Oriental
acts he has the advantage of complete independence, since
for him there is nothing fixed and determined. The freer
and more undetermined his substance is, the more arbitrary
and independent is he. A free substance such as this no
more has the character of an objectivity which is valid
for all universally than it has freedom. What we call rights,
moral standards, the state, are there present in a natural,
substantial, patriarchal way, i.e., without subjective freedom.
The kind of morality which we call conscience is also
nonexistent there. What does exist there is a petrified
natural order which permits what is worst to exist side by
side with supreme nobility. The situation is such that in
it supreme arbitrariness holds the highest place.
Consequently philosophical knowledge is not to be looked
for in the Orient, since it is proper to philosophical knowledge
to be conscious of, to know, the substance, i.e., the
universal insofar as I think it, develop it within me, determine
it, in such a way that in the substance I have my own
determinations and am also contained subjectively or
affirmatively. In this way the determinations in question
are not merely subjective, not merely opinions, but just as
they are my thoughts so too are they thoughts of what is
objective; they. are substantial thoughts.
What belongs to the Orient, then, is to be excluded from
the history of philosophy. Still, in the overall treatment,.
I shall, nevertheless, say a few words about it, particularly
the Indian and the Chinese. Previously I have ignored
Oriental thought, but recently it has become possible to
pass judgment in its regard. Formerly it was customary to
acclaim Indian wisdom and even to make a great fuss about
it, without anyone knowing exactly why. Only now do we
have more precise information, which corresponds naturally
HEGEL's ln:EA OF' PtuLOSOPHY
to its somewhat general character. It is not enough, how·
ever, simply to contrast the universal concept with the
former sort of vague conjecture; we must now, wherever
possible, proceed historically.
Philosophy properly so called has its beginning only in
the West. There the spirit is submerged in itself, immerses
itself in itself, posits itself as free, and is free for itself. Only
under such conditions can philosophy exist; and by the
same token, only in the West do we find free political institutions.
The happiness and the infinity which characterize
the individual in the West are determined in such a way
that within the substantial the subject holds its own, is not
demeaned, does not appear as a slave, destined for annihilation
in its dependence on the substance.
II. Progress in the History of Philosophy
In the West, then, we stand on philosophy's own proper
ground. There we must consider two great forms, we must
distinguish two main periods: (1) Greek philosophy, and
(2) Germanic philosophy. The latter is philosophy in the
framework of Christianity or philosophy insofar as it pertains
to the Germanic peoples, which is the reason why it
can be called Germanic philosophy. Through the influence
of the Germanic nations the other European nations
-Italy, Spain, France, England, etc.-have taken on a
new form.
Greek philosophy differs from Germanic philosophy just
as much as Greek art does from Germanic art. Greek influence,
however, reaches into the Germanic world, and the
Romans constitute the link between the two. In speaking
of Greek philosophy we must speak of it as settling in the
Roman world, because Greek culture was adopted in the
Roman world. The Romans, however, no more produced
a philosophy of their own than a poetry of their own; even
their religion is properly speaking Greek.
To characterize more precisely the two major conHegel:
Introduction 129
trasting forms we can say that the Greek world developed
thought into the Idea, whereas the Christian or Germanic
world comprehended the thought of Spirit. The line of
demarcation is that between idea and spirit.
We can describe this advance more precisely in the following
way. The first step in the process is necessarily the
most abstract; it is the simplest and most impoverished, in
contrast to the concrete. It is not yet diversified, not yet
determined in a variety of ways; and, thus, the most ancient
philosophies are the poorest of all. The first stage, then, is
totally simple. After this, more precise determinations and
figurations are constructed on this simple basis. When, for
example, it is said that the universal, the absolute, is water
or the infinite or being, then the universal has been determined
as water, the infinite, or being. Still, the determinations
themselves remain thoroughly general, non-conceptual,
and undetermined. Likewise, when it is said that the
universal is the atom, the one, this too is an indeterminate
determination. The next stage in the development is the
grasp of the universal as aware of itself, self-determiningit
is thought as active in a universal way. What comes at
this stage is more concrete, but it is still somewhat abstract.
It is the vo~ of Anaxagoras or, better still, of Socrates, the
beginning of a subjective totality, where thinking comprehends
itself, and vovs is determined as being thinking
activity. At a third stage this abstract totality has to
realize itself, and that in diversified determinations (active
thought is that which determines and diversifies), and these
diversified, realized determinations are themselves elevated
to totalities. On this level the universal and the particular
are contrasted, as are thinking as such and external reality,
or indications of externality, such as sensations, etc. Stoicism
and Epicureanism become contrasting philosophies; and
these contraries are united in a higher. This latter can
consist in a destruction of the other two, as in skepticism;
but the affirmative union of the two is their synthesis
HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
(Aufhebung) in a higher totality, in the Idea. This stage
can be called a realization of the concept. The concept is
the universal, which is determined for itself and yet retains
its unity along with its determination into individualities
in such a way that the latter are transparent to it.
Thus, when I say I, many determinations are involved,
but the determinations are mine, they do not become independent;
in them I continue to be the same myself. A
further step is the realization of the concept, such that the
determinations themselves become totalities (the infinite
goodness of the concept), participating fully in the concept,
with the result that the latter's aspects become totalities
separated from each other, whether indifferently side by
side or in conflict with each other. This third level is
one of unification, where the Idea is such that differences
are concrete and at the same time are contained (or have
been held) in the unity of the concept. Greek philosophy
came that far. It closes with the intellectual, ideal world
of Alexandrian philosophy.
In this world, however, in this idea of totality, one
determination is still lacking. I said, you will recall, that the
Idea is, that the concept determines itself, particularizes
itself, that it develops its two major aspects, positing them
as identical. In this identity the independent totalities
which are the aspects are also posited as negative; and it
is through this negation that the identity becomes subjectivity,
absolute being-for-itself, i.e., actuality. In this
way the Idea is elevated to Spirit. Spirit is the subjectivity
which knows itself. It is its own object; and its object (i.e.,
itself) it makes into a totality. Thus, it is itself totality and
knows itself as totality for itself. This principle of absolute
being-for-itself or of freedom is the principle of the Christian
world, wherein the one determination is precisely this,
that as such man has an infinite worth. Christian religion
expresses this more precisely by saying that each individual
is to attain blessedness. Thereby an infinite worth is
Hegel: Introduction
attributed to each individual. The principle of the second
epoch, therefore, is the Idea knowing itself.
I£ we want to represent this advance to ourselves imaginatively
we can speak of thinking as though it were space.
First of all appear the most abstract determinations of
space, i.e., points and lines; thereafter the union of these
in a triangle. This latter, it is true, is already concrete, but
still in the abstract element of surface; a stage which corresponds
to what we called vov~. The next stage is that the
three lines which bound it become whole figures, i.e., become
the realization of the abstract, of the abstract sides of
the whole. At a third stage the three surfaces, triangular
sides, are joined together into a body, a totality. That is as
far as Greek philosophy goes.
Once we have such a body there enters in a distinction
between the center of the [enclosed] space and that which
fills it [its area]. This then results in a contrast between
what is totally simple and ideal (which the center is) and
what is real and substantial. The uniting of both, then,
is the totality of the self-knowing Idea-no longer, however,
a disinterested uniting, but such that the center is selfknowing
personality over against objective, physical corporeity.
Within this totality of the self-knowing idea the
substantial is, on the one hand, essentially distinguished
from subjectivity; and yet, on the other hand, the latter as
self-positing also becomes substantial. At first, of course,
subjectivity is merely formal, but it is the real possibility
of the substantial. Subjectivity in and for itself consists precisely
in this, that the subject has the determination of
fulfilling its universality, of realizing it, and of positing
itself as identical with the substance.
Thus, the principle of philosophy in the modern era
on the one hand consists in the moment of ideality or subjectivity
being for itself as such or in existing as singularity.
With this there comes into being what we call subjective
freedom. This latter, however, is at the same time
HEGEL's IDEA oF PHILOSOPHY'
universal, since the subject as such, i.e., man as man, is
free and has the infinite determination of becoming substantial,
which is the other determination found in Christian
religion, namely that man has the capacity to be
spirit. The sort of subjective and universal freedom which
we see here is something entirely different from the partial
freedom which we saw in Greece. Among the Greeks it
was properly speaking only contingent that the subjectivity
be free. In the Oriental world only one is free,
i.e., the substance. The Spartan or Attic citizen is free, but
among them there were also slaves, and so in the Greek
world only some are free. What we are now saying is something
else again; we say that man as man is free. In this way
the characteristic freedom is completely universal. The
subject as such is thought of as free, and the characteristic
applies to all.q
In the Christian religion the principle of which we speak
has been rather expressed in the form of feeling and representation
than articulated in the form of pure thought.
The religion includes the belief that man as man, each
individual, is an object of divine grace and mercy; thus
each is a subject for himself and has an infinite, absolute
value. More precisely, this principle is to be found in the
fact that the Christian religion contains as a dogma the
recognition of the unity between divine and human nature,
a truth which has been revealed to men through Christ.
Here man and God, the subjective and the objective idea,
are one. This latter is the Germanic principle, the uniting
of objectivity and subjectivity. The same teaching is already
contained in a different guise in the story of the Fall. What
is essential in this story is that the tree from which Adam
eats is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; the rest
• Where the possession of rights is contingent upon such arbitrary
factors as birth or belonging to a particular class, not spiritual
but "natural" factors, there can be no consciousness of being
essentially free, essentially the subject of rights.
Hegel: Introduction
is simply imaginary. From this point of view the serpent
did not deceive man, for God says: "See, Adam has become
like one of us; he knows what is good and ev.i.l." In that is
contained the infinite, divine worth of subjectivity. Still,
the unity of the subjective principle with substantiality, the
unity of knowledge and truth, is not immediate; it is a
process, the process of spirit. This means that in its unity
subjectivity divests itself of its natural, immediate manner
of being one and makes itself identical with what has been
called the simply substantial (subjectivity as such is merely
formal). Here, then, the goal of man is announced to be
supreme blessedness and perfection-first of all in principle,
in abstracto; the goal, then, is subjectivity which has
in itself infinite worth, determined in regard to po~sibility.
We see, then, that speculative thought and religious
representation are not separated, above all not so widely
separated as is customarily believed. I have introduced
such notions for another reason, i.e., in order that we be
not o£ the opinion that as notions belonging to an earlier
stage in the Christian world they are no longer of interest
to us, even though we belong to that world. As a result of
this, even though we may well have advanced beyond this
stage we have no reason to be ashamed of our ancestors, for
whom religious notions such as these were of supreme
importance.
Properly speaking, then, we have two ideas, the subjective
idea as knowing and the substantial or concrete idea;
and the development or extension of this principle in such
a way that it comes to consciousness in thought is the concern
of modern philosophy. Here it is, then, that determinations
are of a more concrete sort than they were among
the ancients, determinations such as distinctions between
thought and being, individuality and substantiality, freedom
and necessity, etc. In modern philosophy, subjectivity
is for itself but posits itself identically with the substantial
or concrete, so that the substantial in question reaches
134 HEGEL'S IDEA OF PHILOSOPHY
thought. The knowing of what is for itself free is the principle
of modern philosophy. There it is that this knowing,
both as immediate certainty and as a knowing which is
yet to be developed, is of particular interest, because
through it the opposition between certainty and belief or
even between belief and the sort of knowing that develops
within itself is constructed. Thus a knowing which is first
to be developed in some subject or other and also the belief
which is a knowing are opposed to certainty or to the true
in general. Consequently subjectivity and objectivity are
opposed to each other. In both, however, the unity of
thinking or subjectivity and truth or objectivity is presupposed.
The difference is that in the first form it is said:
existing man (i.e., natural man in his immediate ordinariness)
cognizes the true in immediate knowing, in believing;
the way he believes it is, so it truly is. In the second form,
on the other hand, it is true that the unity of knowing and
truth is also present, but at the same time there is the fact
that man, the subject, raises himself above sensible consciousness,
above the immediate manner of knowing, and
only through thought makes himself what he is, thus attaining
to truth.
On the whole, then, we have two philosophies: (1) Greek
and ( 2) Germanic. With regard to the second of these we
must distinguish between the period in which it makes its
appearance as philosophy and the period of preparation.
We can begin to deal with Germanic philosophy only at
the point where it makes its appearance in a form peculiar
to itself. Between the two great periods, then, lies a middle
period, one of fermentation.
The point at which we now stand is the result of all the
work that has been done over a period of 2300 years; it
is what the World-Spirit has brought before itself in its
thinking consciousness. We should not wonder at the slowness
of this. Universal, knowing Spirit has time, it is not in
a hurry; it has at its disposal masses of peoples and nations

whose development is precisely a means to the emergence of
its consciousness. Nor should we become impatient because
particular insights are not brought out at this time but only
later, or that this or that is not yet there-in world-history
advances are slow. Thus, insight into the necessity of such
a long time is a remedy for our impatience.
We have, then, to consider three periods in the history
of philosophy: ( 1) Greek philosophy from Thales, about
6oo B.c. (Thales was born in either 640 or 629 B.c. and died
in either the 58th or 59th Olympiad, i.e., about 550 B.c.),
to the Neoplatonists, among whom was Plotinus who lived
in the third century after Christ. It can be said, however,
that this period stretched into the fifth century, at which
time on the one hand all pagan philosophy is at an end-a
fact which is connected with the great migration and the
downfall of the Roman Empire (the death of Proclus, last
of the great Neoplatonists, is put in A.D. 485 and the sack of
Rome under Odoacer in 476)-whereas on the other hand
Neoplatonism continues without interruption in the work
of the Church Fathers-many philosophies within Christendom
have as their only foundation Neoplatonism. The
time-span, then, takes in about 1000 years. (2) The second
period is that of the Middle Ages, the period of fermentation
and of preparation for modern philosophy. Here
belong the Scholastics. There are also Arab and Jewish
philosophies to be mentioned, but the most important
ones were those of the Christian Church. This period, too,
lasts about 1000 years. (3) The third period, when modern
philosophy makes its formal appearance, does not begin
until the time of the Thirty Years' War, with Bacon (d.
1626), Jakob Boehme (d. 1624), or Descartes (d. 1650). With
Descartes thinking began to enter into itself. "Cogito ergo
sum" are th.~,,~rst words of his system; and it is precisely
these words which express the difference between modern
philosophy and all that preceded it.
