# Installing Roo Code

2.  Access Extensions: Click the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS)
3.  Search for "Roo Code"
4.  Select "Roo Code" by RooVeterinaryInc and click **Install**
5.  Reload VS Code if prompted

After installation, find the Roo Code icon () in the Activity Bar to open the Roo Code panel.
