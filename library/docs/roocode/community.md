## Roo Code Tips & Tricks by [@Michaelzag](https://github.com/Michaelzag)

[Roo Code Tips & Tricks](https://github.com/Michaelzag/RooCode-Tips-Tricks) is a collection of files designed to supercharge your Roo Code experience and maximize productivity. For those looking for a memory management system: check out the [Handoff System](https://github.com/Michaelzag/RooCode-Tips-Tricks/blob/main/handoffs/handoff-system.md) which is a simple yet powerful way to maintain optimal LLM performance during extended projects while automatically creating valuable documentation. 

## Roo Code Dynamic Rules by [@cannuri](https://github.com/cannuri)

Inspired by LangMem, this simple Rule allows you to define new rules and delete them on the fly simply by writing `RULE/NORULE: (your new rule)` in your message. Roo Code will then add it to or remove it from the `.clinerules` file. This way you can quickly define project specific rules on the fly and build them up step by step. Check out [Roo Code Dynamic Rules](https://github.com/cannuri/roo-code-dynamic-rules) on Github.

### Orchestrator by [@iiwish](https://github.com/iiwish)

An enhanced workflow orchestration mode based on [@mrubens](https://github.com/mrubens)' original design, with expanded capabilities for complex task management. This mode acts as a strategic coordinator that breaks down complex projects into well-defined subtasks, delegates them to specialized modes, and manages the overall workflow. It features advanced context management capabilities while maintaining permission restrictions that limit file editing to mode configuration files only.

## Key Enhancements

- **Granular Task Decomposition**: Strategies optimized for context length limitations.
- **Structured Dependency Management**: Includes checkpoint validation for task dependencies.
- **Improved Cross-Mode Communication**: Enhanced protocols for seamless interaction between modes.
- **Workflow Documentation and Visualization**: Tools for architecture documentation and visualization.
- **Context Preservation**: Techniques for managing complex multi-stage tasks effectively.

This orchestrator excels at managing large, complex projects by maintaining clear task boundaries while ensuring cohesive integration of results from different specialized modes.
