# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for extending Roo Code's capabilities by connecting to external tools and services. MCP servers provide additional tools and resources that help Roo accomplish tasks beyond its built-in capabilities, such as accessing databases, custom APIs, and specialized functionality.

## MCP Documentation

This documentation is organized into several sections:

*   [**Using MCP in Roo Code**](using-mcp-in-roo.md) - Comprehensive guide to configuring, enabling, and managing MCP servers with Roo Code. Includes server settings, tool approval, and troubleshooting.
*   [**What is MCP?**](what-is-mcp.md) - Clear explanation of the Model Context Protocol, its client-server architecture, and how it enables AI systems to interact with external tools.
*   [**STDIO & SSE Transports**](server-transports.md) - Detailed comparison of local (STDIO) and remote (SSE) transport mechanisms with deployment considerations for each approach.
*   [**MCP vs API**](mcp-vs-api.md) - Analysis of the fundamental distinction between MCP and REST APIs, explaining how they operate at different layers of abstraction for AI systems.
