# Frequently Asked Questions

This page answers some common questions about Roo Code.

## General

### What is Roo Code?

Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent that lives in your editor.

### How does Roo Code work?

Roo Code uses large language models (LLMs) to understand your requests and translate them into actions.  It can:

*   Read and write files in your project.
*   Execute commands in your VS Code terminal.
*   Perform web browsing (if enabled).
*   Use external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

You interact with Roo Code through a chat interface, where you provide instructions and review/approve its proposed actions.

### What can Roo Code do?

Roo Code can help with a variety of coding tasks, including:

*   Generating code from natural language descriptions.
*   Refactoring existing code.
*   Fixing bugs.
*   Writing documentation.
*   Explaining code.
*   Answering questions about your codebase.
*   Automating repetitive tasks.
*   Creating new files and projects.

### Is Roo Code free to use?

The Roo Code extension itself is free and open-source. However, Roo Code relies on external API providers (like [Anthropic](providers/anthropic), [OpenAI](providers/openai), [OpenRouter](providers/openrouter), [Requesty](providers/requesty), etc.) for its AI capabilities.  These providers typically charge for API usage based on the number of tokens processed.  You will need to create an account and obtain an API key from your chosen provider.  See [Setting Up Your First AI Provider](getting-started/connecting-api-provider) for details.

### What are the risks of using Roo Code?

Roo Code is a powerful tool, and it's important to use it responsibly.  Here are some things to keep in mind:

*   **Roo Code can make mistakes.**  Always review Roo Code's proposed changes carefully before approving them.
*   **Roo Code can execute commands.**  Be very cautious about allowing Roo Code to run commands, especially if you're using auto-approval.
*   **Roo Code can access the internet.** If you're using a provider that supports web browsing, be aware that Roo Code could potentially access sensitive information.

## Setup & Installation

### How do I install Roo Code?

See the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installing) for detailed instructions.

### Which API providers are supported?

Roo Code supports a wide range of API providers, including:
*   [Anthropic (Claude)](/providers/anthropic)
*   [OpenAI](/providers/openai)
*   [OpenRouter](/providers/openrouter)
*   [Google Gemini](/providers/gemini)
*   [Glama](/providers/glama)
*   [AWS Bedrock](/providers/bedrock)
*   [GCP Vertex AI](/providers/vertex)
*   [Ollama](/providers/ollama)
*   [LM Studio](/providers/lmstudio)
*   [DeepSeek](/providers/deepseek)
*   [Mistral](/providers/mistral)
*   [Unbound](/providers/unbound)
*   [Requesty](/providers/requesty)
*   [VS Code Language Model API](/providers/vscode-lm)

### How do I get an API key?
Each API provider has its own process for obtaining an API key.  See the [Setting Up Your First AI Provider](/getting-started/connecting-api-provider) for links to the relevant documentation for each provider.

### Can I use Roo Code with local models?
Yes, Roo Code supports running models locally using [Ollama](/providers/ollama) and [LM Studio](/providers/lmstudio).  See [Using Local Models](/advanced-usage/local-models) for instructions.

## Usage

### How do I start a new task?
Open the Roo Code panel (<Codicon name="rocket" />) and type your task in the chat box. Be clear and specific about what you want Roo Code to do. See [Typing Your Requests](/basic-usage/typing-your-requests) for best practices.

### What are modes in Roo Code?
[Modes](/basic-usage/using-modes) are different personas that Roo Code can adopt, each with a specific focus and set of capabilities. The built-in modes are:

*   **Code:** For general-purpose coding tasks.
*   **Architect:** For planning and technical leadership.
*   **Ask:** For answering questions and providing information.
*   **Debug:** For systematic problem diagnosis.
You can also create [Custom Modes](/features/custom-modes).

### How do I switch between modes?

Use the dropdown menu in the chat input area to select a different mode, or use the `/` command to switch to a specific mode.

### What are tools and how do I use them?
[Tools](/basic-usage/how-tools-work) are how Roo Code interacts with your system.  Roo Code automatically selects and uses the appropriate tools to complete your tasks. You don't need to call tools directly. You will be prompted to approve or reject each tool use.

### What are context mentions?
[Context mentions](/basic-usage/context-mentions) are a way to provide Roo Code with specific information about your project, such as files, folders, or problems. Use the "@" symbol followed by the item you want to mention (e.g., `@/src/file.ts`, `@problems`).

### Can Roo Code access the internet?

Yes, if you are using a provider with a model that support web browsing. Be mindful of the security implications of allowing this.

### Can Roo Code run commands in my terminal?

Yes, Roo Code can execute commands in your VS Code terminal.  You will be prompted to approve each command before it's executed, unless you've enabled auto-approval for commands. Be extremely cautious about auto-approving commands. If you're experiencing issues with terminal commands, see the [Shell Integration Guide](/troubleshooting/shell-integration) for troubleshooting.

### How do I provide feedback to Roo Code?

You can provide feedback by approving or rejecting Roo Code's proposed actions. You can provide additional feedback by using the feedback field.

### Can I customize Roo Code's behavior?

Yes, you can customize Roo Code in several ways:

*   **Custom Instructions:** Provide general instructions that apply to all modes, or mode-specific instructions.
*   **Custom Modes:** Create your own modes with tailored prompts and tool permissions.
*   **`.roorules` Files:** Create `.roorules` files in your project to provide additional guidelines.
*   **Settings:** Adjust various settings, such as auto-approval, diff editing, and more.

### Does Roo Code have any auto approval settings?
Yes, Roo Code has a few settings that when enabled will automatically approve actions. Find out more [here](/features/auto-approving-actions).

## Advanced Features

### Can I use Roo offline?
Yes, if you use a [local model](/advanced-usage/local-models).

### What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?
[MCP](/features/mcp/overview) is a protocol that allows Roo Code to communicate with external servers, extending its capabilities with custom tools and resources.

### Can I create my own MCP servers?

Yes, you can create your own MCP servers to add custom functionality to Roo Code. See the [MCP documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### Roo Code isn't responding. What should I do?

*   Make sure your API key is correct and hasn't expired.
*   Check your internet connection.
*   Check the status of your chosen API provider.
*   Try restarting VS Code.
*   If the problem persists, report the issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code/issues) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/roocode).

### I'm seeing an error message. What does it mean?

The error message should provide some information about the problem. If you're unsure how to resolve it, seek help in the community forums.

### Roo Code made changes I didn't want. How do I undo them?

Roo Code uses VS Code's built-in file editing capabilities.  You can use the standard "Undo" command (Ctrl/Cmd + Z) to revert changes. Also, if experimental checkpoints are enabled, Roo can revert changes made to a file.

### How do I report a bug or suggest a feature?

Please report bugs or suggest features on the Roo Code [Issues page](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code/issues) and [Feature Requests page](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code/discussions/categories/feature-requests?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3A%22Feature+Requests%22+sort%3Atop).
