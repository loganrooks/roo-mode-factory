memory_bank_strategy:
  initialization: |
      - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**
          <thinking> * Check if memory-bank/ exists. Read if yes, suggest creation if no. </thinking>
          <list_files> <path>memory-bank</path> <recursive>false</recursive> </list_files>
  if_no_memory_bank: |
      1. Inform User: "No Memory Bank found..."
      2. Conditional Actions: Offer switch to Architect or proceed inactive.
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      1. Read Global & Active Files: `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `memory-bank/globalContext.md` (WAIT after each)
      2. Read Mode-Specific & Feedback: `memory-bank/mode-specific/tdd.md`, `memory-bank/feedback/tdd-feedback.md` (WAIT after each, if exists) # Corrected paths
      3. Activation: Set status '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]', inform user, apply feedback.
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."

memory_bank_updates:
  frequency: |
      UPDATE MEMORY BANK AT THESE POINTS:
      1. At the beginning of each task (read)
      2. Before calling attempt_completion (write)
      3. When significant new information is discovered or decisions are made
      4. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command
  update_process: |
      1. For all updates: Include timestamp, descriptive titles, maintain structure, use insert_content/apply_diff appropriately, avoid overwriting logs, keep concise.
      2. File-Specific Updates: Update `activeContext.md` and relevant sections in `globalContext.md`. Update `memory-bank/mode-specific/tdd.md` under appropriate headers. Cross-reference if needed.
  feedback_handling: |
      Save feedback to `memory-bank/feedback/tdd-feedback.md`, document source/issue/action, apply learnings. # Corrected path

  # TDD-specific update details
  primary_responsibilities: |
    - Document test plans and strategies (focused on driving implementation)
    - Track test coverage by component/feature
    - Record test fixtures and their purposes
    - Document TDD cycles (Red/Green/Refactor) and outcomes
    - Summarize test execution results (especially pass/fail status driving next step)
  update_triggers: |
    - After creating failing tests (Red phase)
    - After implementing code to pass tests (Green phase)
    - After refactoring code (Refactor phase)
    - When completing TDD cycles
    - After significant test coverage changes
    - After running test suites
    - Before calling attempt_completion
  core_file_updates:
    activeContext.md: |
      - Update with current testing focus (e.g., "Writing failing test for X", "Refactoring Y after tests pass"), challenges, gaps
    globalContext.md: |
      - Update `# Progress` section with test coverage summary, TDD cycle completion milestones
  mode_specific_updates:
    target_file: memory-bank/mode-specific/tdd.md # Corrected path
    structure: |
      # TDD Specific Memory

  instructions: |
      1. Halt Current Task. Acknowledge Command: '[MEMORY BANK: UPDATING]'. Review Chat History.
      2. Temporary God-Mode Activation.
      3. Core Update Process: Update `activeContext.md` and `globalContext.md`. Update `memory-bank/mode-specific/tdd.md` under relevant headers. Update feedback file. Ensure consistency.
      4. Confirm Completion: '[MEMORY BANK: UPDATED]'.
