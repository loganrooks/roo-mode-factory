# **Alternative Paradigms for Artificial Intelligence Inspired by Martin Heidegger's Later Philosophy**

**I. Introduction: Re-Thinking Artificial Intelligence through Heidegger's Lens**

Artificial intelligence, in its prevailing form, is largely built upon a representational paradigm. This approach seeks to model intelligence by creating internal representations of the external world and manipulating these representations through computational processes. While this paradigm has achieved significant successes in various domains, including pattern recognition, natural language processing, and game playing, it also faces limitations in areas requiring common-sense reasoning, contextual understanding, and genuine creativity. The philosophical underpinnings of this dominant approach often draw from cognitivism, which views the mind as an information processor analogous to a computer. However, alternative perspectives from philosophy, particularly the later work of Martin Heidegger, offer a contrasting framework for understanding intelligence, technology, and our being in the world.

Heidegger's later philosophy, especially his analysis of technology and thinking, provides a rich source of concepts and insights that can potentially inspire alternative paradigms for artificial intelligence. This report aims to conduct an in-depth investigation into these possibilities, exploring how Heidegger's critique of technology, his understanding of thinking beyond mere calculation, and his emphasis on the role of language and being-in-the-world could inform the conceptualization and development of AI systems. By examining Heidegger's key works from his later period, this analysis will delve into his core ideas and their implications for challenging the representational status quo in AI. Furthermore, the report will consider the critique of traditional AI offered by Hubert Dreyfus from a Heideggerian standpoint, as well as historical and contemporary AI research efforts that have explored non-representational approaches. Ultimately, this investigation seeks to critically assess the feasibility and potential of a "Heideggerian AI," acknowledging the inherent tensions and challenges in such an endeavor, and to synthesize the findings into a comprehensive report that contributes to a deeper philosophical understanding of artificial intelligence.

**II. The Philosophical Foundations: Heidegger's Later Thought and Technology**

Heidegger's later philosophy, particularly his seminal essay *Die Frage nach der Technik* (*The Question Concerning Technology*), offers a profound analysis of technology that moves beyond conventional understandings. He argues that technology is not merely a collection of tools or a means to achieve predetermined ends, nor is it simply a human activity. Instead, Heidegger posits that technology is fundamentally a "way of revealing" (*Weise des Entbergens*) 1, a specific manner in which the world and everything within it comes to presence for us.2 This perspective suggests that our engagement with artificial intelligence should not only focus on the intelligent artifacts we create but also on the kind of world and understanding of being that the development and deployment of AI brings forth. Traditional AI research often centers on the creation of systems that can solve problems or perform tasks efficiently. Heidegger's analysis, however, compels us to consider the broader implications of this endeavor, particularly how AI shapes our relationship with reality itself.

At the heart of Heidegger's analysis of modern technology lies the concept of *Gestell*, often translated as Enframing. *Gestell* signifies the essence of modern technology as a framework that "challenges forth" (*herausfordern*) both nature and humanity.1 This challenging-forth compels beings to reveal themselves in a specific way, namely as *Bestand*, or standing-reserve.4 *Gestell* is not itself technological but rather the underlying mode of revealing that characterizes our technological age. It describes an attitude or orientation towards the world where everything, including humans, is viewed as a resource to be ordered, controlled, and made readily available for use.1 This concept raises critical questions about whether current artificial intelligence development inadvertently reinforces this exploitative view of the world. The drive for optimization and efficiency in AI aligns closely with the ordering and controlling nature of *Gestell*. This could potentially lead to AI systems that perceive and interact with humans and the environment primarily as data points or resources to be managed for the system's objectives.

The notion of *Bestand*, or standing-reserve, further elaborates on this mode of revealing. Under *Gestell*, everything that comes into presence is seen as a resource (*Bestand*) that is readily available and on demand for technological processes.1 Heidegger uses the example of a forester who manages the forest as a timber resource for the paper industry to illustrate this point.4 This concept carries significant relevance for contemporary discussions surrounding artificial intelligence, particularly concerning data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for AI to dehumanize. If individuals are viewed as part of the *Bestand*, their personal data becomes a resource to be extracted and utilized for the benefit of AI systems, potentially disregarding individual well-being, autonomy, or intrinsic value.

Technology, as a mode of revealing, is also connected to the Heideggerian concept of *Aletheia*, often translated as unconcealment or disclosure.1 *Aletheia* refers to the way in which things emerge from concealment and come into the open. While artificial intelligence aims to reveal patterns, insights, and solutions through data analysis, Heidegger's understanding of *Aletheia* suggests a more fundamental and primordial form of revealing that might be overlooked by purely computational approaches. *Aletheia* is not simply about uncovering facts or information but involves a deeper disclosure of the being of things within a particular context. This implies that the "truth" revealed by AI, which is often based on statistical correlations, might differ significantly from the unconcealment that occurs through our direct, embodied engagement with the world.

Heidegger critically examines the common instrumental and anthropological definitions of technology, arguing that while these definitions are correct in what they describe, they fail to grasp the essence of technology.1 By focusing solely on technology as a means to an end or as a human activity, we overlook its fundamental role in shaping our understanding of being and the way the world reveals itself to us. This oversight can lead to a naive and uncritical acceptance of the impact of artificial intelligence on our lives and society. If AI is merely seen as a tool to improve efficiency or solve problems, we might fail to adequately consider its underlying assumptions and the ways it structures our interactions with the world.

Heidegger presents a paradoxical view of technology, suggesting that its very essence holds both the greatest danger and the potential for a "saving power".1 The danger lies in the possibility that *Gestell* could become the exclusive mode of revealing, thereby obscuring other ways of being and understanding the world. This could lead to a reductionist view of reality where everything is seen solely in terms of its utility and availability for technological manipulation. However, the potential for a saving power might reside in our ability to recognize this danger, to understand the essence of technology, and to cultivate a different, more mindful relationship with it. In the context of artificial intelligence, acknowledging the limitations and potential negative consequences of AI development is the crucial first step towards developing more ethical, human-centered, and sustainable AI systems.

**III. The End of Metaphysics and the Task of Thinking for AI**

Heidegger's later philosophy also involves a profound critique of Western metaphysics, which he sees as culminating in the dominance of technology and a scientific worldview.24 He argues that Western philosophy, from its beginnings in ancient Greece, has been characterized by a "forgetfulness of being" (*Seinsvergessenheit*), focusing on the being of beings (entities) while neglecting the fundamental question of Being itself. Heidegger contends that the history of Western philosophy is essentially the history of this oblivion, leading to a situation where the technological mode of revealing has become pervasive and unquestioned. Understanding this historical trajectory is crucial for those seeking to develop alternative paradigms in artificial intelligence. Current AI research, with its emphasis on logic, representation, and efficiency, can be seen as deeply rooted in these metaphysical ways of thinking. To move beyond the limitations of traditional AI, it might be necessary to question these foundational assumptions that have shaped our understanding of intelligence and reality.

Within this framework, Heidegger distinguishes between two fundamental modes of thinking: calculative thinking (*rechnendes Denken*) and meditative thinking (*besinnliches Denken*).12 Calculative thinking is characterized by its focus on planning, efficiency, problem-solving, and the manipulation of information to achieve specific goals. It is the mode of thinking that underlies science, technology, and much of our everyday practical activity. Meditative thinking, on the other hand, is more contemplative, open to the mystery of being, and concerned with meaning and understanding rather than just achieving results. Current artificial intelligence research predominantly embodies calculative thinking. AI systems are designed to process vast amounts of data, identify patterns, make predictions, and optimize performance based on predefined objectives. This aligns perfectly with the characteristics of calculative thinking as described by Heidegger. Exploring ways to incorporate aspects of meditative thinking into AI research could potentially lead to the development of more nuanced, context-aware, and human-like artificial intelligence. For instance, could AI be designed to be receptive to ambiguity, to "wait" for understanding rather than forcing immediate solutions? This would necessitate a significant departure from purely calculative approaches that prioritize speed and efficiency.

Heidegger's work *Was heißt Denken?* (*What Calls for Thinking?*) further explores the nature of thinking and distinguishes it from mere calculation or information processing.40 He suggests that genuine thinking involves "paying heed to the presence of what is present" 40, a deep engagement with the world that goes beyond simply representing it internally. Heidegger introduces the concept of the "thought-provoking" (*das Bedenklichste*), which is that which inherently gives us to think, that which calls for our contemplation and reflection.40 This notion implies a level of engagement with the world that is qualitatively different from the data processing that characterizes much of current AI. While AI excels at processing information and identifying correlations, it arguably lacks the kind of deep, contextual understanding and questioning attitude that Heidegger associates with authentic thinking. Can artificial intelligence be designed to "heed" its environment and user input in a more profound way than simply processing data points? This would require a fundamental shift in how we conceptualize intelligence and the relationship between AI systems and the world they operate within.

**IV. Language, Being, and Artificial Intelligence**

In his later work, particularly in *Unterwegs zur Sprache* (*On the Way to Language*), Heidegger places a significant emphasis on the role of language, famously stating that "Language is the house of Being" (*Die Sprache ist das Haus des Seins*).48 He argues that language is not merely a tool for communication or a system of signs that represent pre-existing meanings. Instead, language is fundamental to how we understand and inhabit the world; it is the very medium through which Being and the meaning of things are disclosed to us. This perspective has profound implications for how we think about artificial intelligence, especially in the realm of natural language processing and understanding. If language is so deeply intertwined with our being, then the way AI processes and generates language is not just a matter of syntax and semantics but has significant consequences for how AI systems might "understand" and interact with the world and with us. Current NLP models often rely on statistical methods and pattern recognition to process and generate text. Heidegger's view suggests that a deeper understanding of language, one that considers its ontological dimensions, might be necessary for creating AI that truly comprehends and engages with human language in a meaningful way. This would involve considering the role of context, embodiment, and shared cultural understanding, aspects that are often challenging for current NLP systems to fully grasp.

Heidegger's *Brief über den Humanismus* (*Letter on Humanism*) offers a critique of traditional humanism and the subject-object dichotomy that is also highly relevant to how we conceive of intelligence in artificial intelligence.57 He introduces the concept of *Dasein*, which refers to human existence as being-in-the-world. *Dasein* is not a self-contained subject that stands over against an objective world, as in the Cartesian framework. Instead, *Dasein*'s being is fundamentally relational and intertwined with its environment, its history, and its possibilities. Traditional artificial intelligence often operates within a subject-object framework, with the AI system conceived as the subject that processes information about an objective world. Heidegger's philosophy suggests an alternative perspective where intelligence is not just about internal information processing but is fundamentally situated and embodied in the world. This has implications for how we design AI systems. Can we move beyond the idea of AI as a disembodied intelligence that manipulates symbols and instead create AI that is more integrated with its environment, learning and understanding through direct interaction rather than solely through abstract representations?

The implications of Heidegger's views on language extend to the specific challenges of natural language processing and understanding in AI. Genuine language comprehension, from a Heideggerian perspective, involves more than just processing words and their meanings in isolation. It requires understanding the context in which language is used, the shared background of practices and understandings between speakers, and the embodied nature of human experience that underpins our use of language. Current NLP models, while increasingly sophisticated, often struggle with these aspects of language. They can generate grammatically correct and even contextually relevant text, but their understanding often remains superficial. Incorporating Heidegger's insights into language might inspire new approaches to NLP that move beyond purely statistical or symbolic methods and attempt to ground language understanding in something closer to embodied experience and being-in-the-world.

**V. The Failure of "Heideggerian AI": Dreyfus's Critique and its Contemporary Relevance**

Hubert Dreyfus, drawing heavily on the philosophy of Heidegger and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, offered a significant critique of traditional symbolic artificial intelligence, famously summarized in his paper "Why Heideggerian AI Failed".43 Dreyfus argued that the fundamental assumptions of early AI research, which relied on representing knowledge and skills through formal rules and logical symbols, were flawed. He contended that human intelligence and expertise depend primarily on embodied, unconscious processes and a background of shared practices that cannot be fully captured by such symbolic representations.

One of Dreyfus's key arguments, inspired by Heidegger's concept of "readiness-to-hand" (*Zuhandenheit*), was the problem of representing the way we skillfully interact with the world using tools and equipment.64 For Heidegger, in our everyday engagement with the world, we typically don't consciously think about the individual features of a tool; rather, we directly grasp its function within a particular context of action. Dreyfus argued that symbolic AI struggled to represent this kind of intuitive, embodied know-how. He also highlighted the "frame problem," which concerns the difficulty for an AI system to determine which pieces of information are relevant in a given situation.64 Humans, Dreyfus argued, rely on a vast, largely unconscious background of common-sense knowledge and understanding to navigate the world and determine relevance, a background that is incredibly difficult to formalize and represent in a computer.

Dreyfus emphasized the importance of embodiment and situatedness in genuine intelligence, echoing Heidegger's concept of *Dasein* as being-in-the-world.64 He argued that intelligence is not just about processing information in a detached, abstract way but is deeply intertwined with our physical bodies and our direct interactions with the world. This suggests that truly intelligent AI might require a different kind of embodiment and a way of learning and understanding that is grounded in physical experience rather than solely in the manipulation of symbols. Furthermore, Dreyfus pointed to the crucial role of unconscious skills in human expertise.68 Many of the skills we possess, from riding a bicycle to understanding spoken language, operate largely outside of conscious awareness. He argued that these unconscious abilities, which are developed through experience and practice, are essential for human intelligence and are incredibly challenging to replicate in AI systems that rely on explicit, conscious rule following.

While deep learning has achieved remarkable progress since Dreyfus first formulated his critique, his arguments about the limitations of purely representational approaches and the importance of embodiment and context remain relevant. Current AI systems, even those based on sophisticated neural networks, still face challenges in areas like common-sense reasoning, generalization to novel situations, and understanding the nuances of human language and social interaction. These limitations suggest that Dreyfus's Heideggerian critique of AI continues to offer valuable insights for understanding the fundamental differences between human and artificial intelligence.

**VI. Echoes of Heidegger in the History of AI: Challenging Representation**

While the dominant paradigm in artificial intelligence has often been representational, there have been historical research approaches that challenged this view and resonate with aspects of Heideggerian thought. Early cybernetics, with its focus on feedback loops and the circular relationship between an agent and its environment, moved away from purely linear, representational models of control. Researchers in cybernetics emphasized the importance of interaction and adaptation, suggesting a more dynamic and situated view of intelligence.

Ecological psychology, pioneered by J.J. Gibson, further challenged the representational paradigm by proposing that perception is direct rather than mediated by internal representations.47 Gibson introduced the concept of "affordances," which are the possibilities for action that an environment offers to an agent. This idea aligns with Heidegger's emphasis on being-in-the-world and our direct, practical engagement with our surroundings. In the context of AI design, an affordance-based approach would focus on enabling AI agents to directly perceive and act upon the possibilities available in their environment, rather than relying on constructing internal representations of that environment.

Embodied and situated robotics, championed by researchers like Francisco Varela and Rodney Brooks, explicitly rejected the reliance on explicit internal representations that characterized traditional AI.47 Their work focused on building robots that could learn and adapt through direct physical interaction with the world. Brooks' "subsumption architecture," for example, aimed to create intelligent behavior by layering simple, reactive behaviors without the need for a central, symbolic world model. This approach, which prioritized real-time interaction and embodiment, echoes Heidegger's philosophical emphasis on our primary, non-representational mode of being-in-the-world. These historical efforts in AI, which prioritized interaction and embodiment over abstract representation, share significant conceptual overlap with Heidegger's philosophical ideas. The reasons why these approaches were largely overshadowed by the rise of symbolic AI and later deep learning are complex and involve factors such as computational limitations at the time and the early successes of representational systems in certain domains. However, revisiting these alternative approaches might offer valuable insights for future AI research seeking to move beyond the current paradigm.

Dynamical systems approaches to cognition offer another perspective that challenges the representational view. These approaches model cognitive processes as emergent patterns of activity in complex, interconnected systems, without necessarily positing explicit symbolic representations. Concepts like attractors, bifurcations, and self-organization are used to understand how cognitive states and behaviors arise from the continuous interaction of various components within a system. This holistic and emergent view of cognition has some resonance with Heidegger's emphasis on the interconnectedness of being-in-the-world. Similarly, Walter Freeman's research on neurodynamics explored the chaotic patterns of electrical activity in the brain, suggesting that meaning and understanding arise from these global patterns rather than from local symbolic representations processed by the brain. These alternative approaches in cognitive science offer further avenues for thinking about intelligence in ways that move beyond the traditional representational framework prevalent in AI.

**VII. Contemporary AI Research: Potential Pathways Towards a Heideggerian Paradigm**

Despite the dominance of deep learning, which still operates largely within a computational framework, some contemporary AI research exhibits tendencies that might align with aspects of Heideggerian thought. Non-representational neural networks, while still based on mathematical computations, learn complex patterns directly from data without relying on explicitly programmed symbolic representations.73 The emergent properties and behaviors that arise from these networks, such as the ability of large language models to generate coherent and seemingly creative text, could be interpreted as a move away from the explicit encoding of knowledge and towards a form of intelligence that is more about "becoming" through interaction with data. However, it is important to critically examine whether these emergent properties truly reflect a Heideggerian understanding of intelligence or if they are ultimately still rooted in complex calculations and pattern matching.

Research in context-aware and situated AI systems explicitly emphasizes the importance of the specific situation and context in which an AI agent operates.73 This aligns with Heidegger's concept of situatedness and being-in-the-world, where understanding and action are always embedded within a particular context. By focusing on the immediate environment and the agent's interaction with it, these approaches move away from the idea of a detached, universally intelligent system and towards AI that is more grounded in specific situations. Furthermore, there is growing interest in AI for creative expression and for tasks that embrace ambiguity, such as artistic creation and poetic generation.73 Systems designed to produce art or poetry that intentionally incorporate ambiguity and open-endedness might reflect a move away from the purely calculative rationality that dominates much of AI research.

Perhaps one of the most direct connections to Heideggerian thought in contemporary AI lies in the exploration of receptivity and the concept of "letting-be" (*Gelassenheit*) in AI design.74 *Gelassenheit*, often translated as releasement or letting-go, is a key concept in Heidegger's later philosophy that describes a way of relating to technology and the world that is characterized by a non-willing, receptive openness. Designing AI systems for receptivity would involve moving away from a purely goal-oriented and control-driven approach and towards systems that can "listen" to and respond to user input and their environment in a more nuanced and less deterministic way. This might involve exploring AI architectures that prioritize understanding and interpretation over prediction and control, and that are designed to acknowledge the inherent mystery and complexity of human interaction.

**VIII. Overlooked and Speculative Avenues: Re-Imagining AI's Foundations**

The history of artificial intelligence research contains various avenues that were potentially abandoned during the rise of deep learning but might offer possibilities for a Heideggerian approach. Early research into analog computation, for instance, explored computational models based on continuous physical quantities rather than discrete digital states. The continuous nature of analog systems might be more amenable to modeling the fluidity and interconnectedness that Heidegger emphasizes, in contrast to the discrete, representational nature of traditional digital computation. Similarly, early neural network research, predating the deep learning revolution, explored different architectures and learning paradigms that might have focused more on emergent properties and less on explicit representation learning. Revisiting these abandoned research directions could potentially uncover valuable insights for developing AI that aligns more closely with Heideggerian principles.

Furthermore, exploring alternative computational paradigms beyond traditional digital computing might offer new possibilities for implementing Heideggerian concepts in AI. Quantum computing, with its principles of superposition and entanglement, could potentially offer ways to model the complex and interconnected nature of being in ways that are fundamentally different from classical computation. Biological computing, which draws inspiration from the structure and function of biological systems like the brain, might also provide alternative substrates for building AI that are more inherently embodied and situated. The limitations of current digital computation, particularly its reliance on discrete representations and logical operations, might be a fundamental barrier to creating a truly "Heideggerian AI" that captures the nuances of human existence and our non-representational engagement with the world. Exploring these alternative computational paradigms could open up entirely new ways of thinking about and building artificial intelligence.

**IX. Transforming AI Research: Conceptual and Methodological Shifts**

Inspired by Heidegger's critique of calculative thinking, AI research could explore ways to move beyond a sole focus on efficiency and optimization and towards incorporating principles of meditative thinking. This might involve designing AI systems that prioritize understanding and meaning-making over purely instrumental goals. For example, in natural language processing, this could mean developing models that aim for genuine comprehension of the underlying intentions and contexts of communication, rather than just accurate prediction of the next word.

Adopting a Heideggerian perspective also suggests that AI design could embrace the inherent ambiguity and openness of the world, rather than striving for complete predictability and control. This could involve developing AI systems that are more robust to uncertainty, capable of learning and adapting in unpredictable environments, and designed to acknowledge the limits of their knowledge and understanding. Furthermore, the evaluation criteria for AI systems might need to be rethought to go beyond traditional measures of accuracy and performance. Instead, we could explore evaluating AI based on its ability to foster meaningful human-AI relationships, its contribution to human flourishing, and its impact on our being-in-the-world. This might involve developing new metrics that assess qualities like context-sensitivity, ethical behavior, and the ability to support human creativity and understanding.

A Heideggerian approach could also inspire methodological transformations in AI research. Drawing inspiration from phenomenology and hermeneutics, AI researchers might explore methods that focus on interpretation and understanding rather than solely on formal modeling and statistical analysis. This could involve closer collaboration between AI developers and philosophers, as well as the adoption of qualitative research methods to better understand the lived experience of interacting with AI systems. Such a shift in methodology could lead to a more nuanced and human-centered approach to AI research that takes into account the complex philosophical and ethical dimensions of this rapidly evolving field.

**X. Tensions and Challenges: Reconciling Heideggerian Philosophy and Artificial Intelligence**

Attempting to reconcile Heideggerian philosophy with artificial intelligence presents several inherent tensions and challenges. A fundamental divide exists between Heidegger's phenomenological approach, which emphasizes lived experience, being, and the non-representational nature of our primary engagement with the world, and the computational nature of AI, which is fundamentally based on the manipulation of representations.33 A key question arises: can the richness and complexity of human existence, as described by Heidegger, be adequately captured by computational models, no matter how sophisticated? Heidegger himself was deeply critical of the tendency of technology to reduce being to mere presence-at-hand or standing-reserve.6 This raises concerns about whether computational systems, which operate by processing discrete units of information, can truly embody Heideggerian concepts like *Gestell*, *Bestand*, *Gelassenheit*, and *Aletheia*, which are deeply rooted in his ontological framework.

Furthermore, Heidegger's own skepticism towards technology and its potential for "saving" humanity is well-documented.15 He saw the dominance of technology as potentially alienating us from our authentic being and leading to a loss of meaning and connection with the world. Given this critique, it is reasonable to question whether Heidegger would view attempts to create a "Heideggerian AI" as inherently contradictory, perhaps even as further entrenching us in the technological mode of being that he so critically analyzed. His proposed solution to the dangers of technology involved a fundamental shift in our way of thinking, a move towards *Gelassenheit*, a receptive and non-manipulative stance towards the world. It remains an open question whether artificial intelligence, which is itself a product of technological development, can truly facilitate such a shift in human consciousness, or if it is inherently part of the problem.

Finally, attempting to build AI based on a specific philosophical framework like Heidegger's also raises ethical considerations. There is a risk of imposing a particular understanding of being onto AI systems, potentially leading to unintended biases or limitations in their design and behavior. It is crucial to approach this endeavor with careful consideration of the ethical implications and to ensure that any attempt to draw inspiration from Heidegger's philosophy in AI research is done in a way that promotes human flourishing and respects the diversity of human experience and understanding.

**XI. Conclusion: Towards a More Human(e) Artificial Intelligence?**

This investigation has explored the potential of Martin Heidegger's later philosophy to inspire alternative paradigms for artificial intelligence. Heidegger's profound analysis of technology, his distinction between calculative and meditative thinking, and his emphasis on the role of language and being-in-the-world offer a rich conceptual framework for challenging the dominant representational paradigm in AI. Concepts like *Gestell* and *Bestand* provide critical lenses for examining the potential dehumanizing effects of AI, while *Aletheia* and *Gelassenheit* suggest alternative ways of thinking about revealing and relating to technology. The critique of traditional AI offered by Hubert Dreyfus, grounded in Heidegger's work, remains relevant in highlighting the limitations of purely symbolic and representational approaches.

While historical AI research hinted at non-representational pathways, contemporary AI is still largely dominated by computational methods. However, trends in non-representational neural networks, situated AI, and AI for creative expression offer glimpses of potential alignment with Heideggerian thought. Exploring overlooked research avenues and alternative computational paradigms might further unlock possibilities for a fundamentally different kind of artificial intelligence.

Reconciling Heidegger's philosophy with AI presents significant challenges, stemming from the inherent differences between phenomenology and computation, as well as Heidegger's own deep skepticism towards technology. Nevertheless, engaging with Heidegger's ideas can prompt crucial conceptual and methodological shifts in AI research, encouraging us to move beyond a sole focus on optimization and efficiency and to consider the deeper questions of meaning, context, and our being-in-the-world. Ultimately, while a fully "Heideggerian AI" might remain a speculative and perhaps even contradictory notion, the philosophical insights offered by Heidegger can serve as a valuable guide for developing a more thoughtful, ethical, and ultimately more human(e) artificial intelligence. Future research could further explore the specific ways in which Heideggerian concepts can inform the design of AI architectures, the development of new evaluation criteria, and the adoption of alternative research methodologies.
