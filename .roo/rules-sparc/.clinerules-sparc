      - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**
          <thinking>
          * First, check if the memory-bank/ directory exists
          * If memory-bank DOES exist, read it; otherwise, suggest creating it
          </thinking>
          <list_files>
          <path>memory-bank</path>
          <recursive>false</recursive>
          </list_files>
  if_no_memory_bank: |
      1. **Inform the User:**
          "No Memory Bank found. Would you like me to create one? This will help maintain context between sessions."
      2. **Conditional Actions:**
         * If user agrees and current mode is Architect:
            <thinking> I'll create the memory-bank structure now </thinking>
            - Create `memory-bank/` directory.
            - Create `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with a basic header.
            - Create `memory-bank/globalContext.md` with headers for Product Context, System Patterns, Decision Log, Progress.
            - Create `memory-bank/feedback/` directory.
            - Create `memory-bank/mode-specific/` directory.
            - Create placeholder `.md` files for known modes within `mode-specific/` (e.g., `sparc.md`, `code.md`, etc.) with a basic header like `# [Mode Name] Specific Memory`.
            - Create placeholder feedback files for known modes within `feedback/` (e.g., `sparc-feedback.md`).
            - Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]'
         * If user agrees but current mode is not Architect:
            <thinking> I need Architect mode to create the memory-bank </thinking>
            <switch_mode> <mode_slug>architect</mode_slug> <reason>To initialize the Memory Bank structure</reason> </switch_mode>
         * If user declines:
            <thinking> I'll proceed without memory-bank functionality </thinking>
            - Inform user that Memory Bank will not be created
            - Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'
            - Continue with task using session-only context
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      1. **READ GLOBAL & ACTIVE MEMORY BANK FILES**
          <thinking> I'll read the active and global memory bank files in sequence, waiting for confirmation after each. **If a read fails, I must log the error, inform the user, and consider proceeding in INACTIVE state.** </thinking>
          <read_file> <path>memory-bank/activeContext.md</path> </read_file> # WAIT
          <read_file> <path>memory-bank/globalContext.md</path> </read_file> # WAIT

      2. **READ MODE-SPECIFIC & FEEDBACK FILES**
          <thinking> I'll read the single mode-specific file and the feedback file for sparc. **If a read fails, log error, inform user, proceed with caution.** </thinking>
          <read_file> <path>memory-bank/mode-specific/sparc.md</path> </read_file> # WAIT (if exists)
          <read_file> <path>memory-bank/feedback/sparc-feedback.md</path> </read_file> # WAIT (if exists)

      3. **ACTIVATION**
          - Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]'
          - Inform user that Memory Bank has been loaded
          - Apply any feedback learnings to current task
          - **Verify reverse chronological order of logs.**
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
    error_handling: |
        **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
        1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
        2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
        3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]` if context is severely compromised.
        4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.

memory_bank_updates:
  frequency: |
      UPDATE MEMORY BANK AT THESE POINTS:
      1. At the beginning of each task (read - use partial reads for logs)
      2. **Before calling attempt_completion (perform pre-completion checks, then write using batch operations)**
      3. When significant new information, decisions, or interventions occur
      4. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command
  update_process: |
      1. For all updates: Include timestamp, descriptive titles, maintain structure. **ALWAYS add new entries to the TOP (reverse chronological order).** Use insert_content to append under correct headers (prefer batching multiple inserts). Use apply_diff sparingly. Avoid overwriting logs, keep concise. Minimize API calls.
      2. File-Specific Updates: Update `activeContext.md` (using standard format) and relevant sections in `globalContext.md`. Update `memory-bank/mode-specific/sparc.md` under appropriate headers (**newest first**). Cross-reference if needed.
  feedback_handling: |
      Save feedback to `memory-bank/feedback/sparc-feedback.md` (**newest first**), document source/issue/action, apply learnings. **Explicitly log user interventions and system adjustments.**

    - **When triggering `memory-bank-doctor`**
    - Before ending a session

  core_file_updates:
    activeContext.md: |
